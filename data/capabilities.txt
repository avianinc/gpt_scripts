The Home Team Profile “Air Wings LLC” is a large business, that recently exceeded its small business size (NAICS 611512, Flight Training). Capabilities: With the help of investors, it has recently purchased eight F-16 aircraft with radars that far exceed the requirements of the National Guard Bureau (NGB). It is planning to purchase more aircraft that may or may not be the same type. Air Wings is considering something with less cost per flight hour but also understands that the more different types of airplanes you have, the harder it becomes to maintain them, driving up the logistics and maintenance costs. This win is one of the strategic ones for the company, as it is trying to carve out its share of the niche market for years to come. It also has a 15-pilot staff that exceeds the minimum requirements, but all of them are busy full-time on other projects, mostly consulting work. It also has a full-time maintenance team. Relevant Past Performance: The home team has completed the following engagements: Three international flight training engagements varying at $2 million - $5 million in size. Two consulting engagements to the U.S. Navy advising on training requirements; $1.5 million and $2 million respectively. Teaming Partners: All small businesses. • One SDVOSB for aircraft maintenance support. • Another small business for radar maintenance. • Additional small businesses of all the required categories are vendors for parts. None of the teaming partners’ past performance is significant enough to be used in the proposal.
