 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it

 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which operates a fleet of advanced fighter jets, including MiG-21s, Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, and Italian MB-339s. The company provides training services to military pilots, simulating real-world threats without the high costs associated with using front-line fighter aircraft.

The article highlights several key points:

1. Cost savings: Draken International's aircraft cost around $7,000 per hour to operate, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for front-line fighter jets like the F-16 or F-35.
2. Extended airframe life: By using Draken's aircraft for training, military pilots can conserve flight hours on their own aircraft, extending their lifespan.
3. Reduced "negative training": Military pilots often have limited flight time, and using Draken's aircraft for certain types of missions (like cruise missile profiles) allows them to focus on more relevant training.

The company is looking to expand its operations to Europe, where there is growing demand for its services. Draken International does not handle high-end missions like those undertaken by US Aggressor units but can simulate a range of third- and fourth-generation threats.

The article also mentions that the company's pilots are drawn from ex-military ranks, with many having previously flown A-4s or F-16s. The MiG-21s, however, required specialized training and guidance from Romanian MRO provider Aerostar.

The remaining articles appear to be unrelated news briefs:

1. Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
2. Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
3. Mesa Air Group, an airline company, has reported its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to recover financially.
The article discusses the growing market for commercial air support contracts, specifically in the field of adversary air services. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are seen as lucrative opportunities for companies providing such services.

Several companies are mentioned as competitors in this market, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies offer a range of services, including adversary air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The article highlights the importance of affordability in these contracts, with the estimated contract value for the CAF US contract being around $6 billion over 10 years. This works out to around $15,000 per flying hour, which is significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C.

To meet the requirements of these contracts, companies may need to acquire and modify aircraft, as well as hire aircrew and maintainers. Partnerships between companies may also be necessary to fulfill the contract demands.

The article concludes that this is an interesting time for the industry, with opportunities for growth and development in the field of commercial air support services.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. The company is unique in its ability to offer tactical fighter jets at a lower cost than traditional military assets.

Draken's fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, Macchi MB-339s, and MiG-21s, sets it apart from other companies in the CAS market. The company's aircraft have undergone significant upgrades, including the installation of APG-66 radars and radar warning receivers (RWRs), making them highly capable and relevant for training purposes.

Draken's pilots and maintainers are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force personnel with extensive experience in tactical aviation. The company's leadership, led by Jared Isaacman, brings a strong business background and passion for aviation to the table.

The company operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, but also has assets stationed at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken plans to expand its services to foreign air forces in the future, capitalizing on the growing demand for contract air services globally.

Draken's strategy is centered around building a robust infrastructure to support its fleet of aircraft, including an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. This approach has allowed the company to offer high-quality training and testing services at a lower cost than traditional military assets, making it an attractive option for the US government and taxpayers.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied a motion for judgment and injunctive relief filed by Draken, a plaintiff in a bid protest case. The court ruled that the case is not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency's decision-making process has not been completed, and any potential unfair treatment or prejudice to Draken cannot be ascertained until an awardee is selected.

The court cited precedent from Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was deemed not fit for judicial review due to uncertainty over the form of a potential transfer of land and in-kind contributions. Similarly, in this case, the outcome of Draken's claims of an unfair evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the agency is still in the pre-award evaluation stage.

The court also rejected Draken's argument that the Agency's protest decision was irrational and lacked a coherent explanation. The court held that it does not have jurisdiction to directly review the Agency's protest decision, but rather reviews the underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them. Interesting times ahead. – Dim Jones  Originally published in MS&T Issue 3, 2018.    Bringing together leaders in airline training to share knowledge, talent, and experience.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.

3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s

ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida. Founded in 2011, it has grown rapidly to become the world's largest private air force. The company operates a fleet of aircraft, including A-4 Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and MB-339s, which are used for training and simulation purposes.

Draken International provides services to the US military, offering a cost-effective alternative to using front-line fighter jets for certain types of missions. The company's aircraft can simulate threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft, freeing up high-end Aggressor units to focus on simulating more advanced threats.

The company's pilots are all ex-military, and they have developed expertise in flying a range of aircraft types. Draken International is currently exploring the possibility of opening a European base, citing growing demand for its services.

The article highlights the benefits of using private air force companies like Draken International, including cost savings and the ability to reduce wear and tear on front-line fighter jets. It also notes that simulators are not a substitute for real aircraft in certain types of training exercises.

The other articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry, covering topics such as Airbus Defence & Space delivering a multi-role tanker transport to a multinational unit, Bell performing the first flight of an upgraded CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the growing demand for commercial air support contracts, particularly in the US and UK, to provide adversary air services to military forces. The contracts, known as ADAIR (US) and ASDOT (UK), are expected to be highly lucrative, with estimated values of $6 billion over 10 years for ADAIR.

Several companies, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and ATAC, are vying for these contracts. These companies offer a range of services, including adversary air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) support, and test chase.

The companies have diverse fleets, including F-16s, F-5Es, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s, which are being upgraded with advanced avionics and radar. The contracts require a high level of aircraft capability, with some requiring supersonic and agile performance.

The estimated cost per flying hour for the ADAIR contract is around $15,000, significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C. However, affordability will be a key issue, and the requirement will likely involve a range of aircraft capabilities.

The contracts are expected to begin in 2019, and companies may need to form partnerships to meet the demand for flying hours, which could require more aircraft than any single bidder currently has active. The article concludes that this is an interesting time for the industry, with opportunities for companies to provide a range of services and capabilities to military forces.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. Here are the main points:

* Draken International is the largest player in the CAS market, with a fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including A-4K Skyhawks, Mig-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.
* The company's aircraft have been upgraded with advanced capabilities, such as radar and avionics, making them tactically relevant adversaries for the US military.
* Draken provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) training, and R&D mission sets.
* The company's pilots are full-time employees trained on one airframe, ensuring expertise and safety.
* Draken operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, and has a presence at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport in California.
* The company's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and a passion for aviation to the table.
* Draken aims to sustain itself through its commitment to purchasing and maintaining high-quality aircraft, as well as its indigenous supply line and expertise in piloting and maintaining the aircraft.
* The company sees potential for expansion outside of the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's capabilities, services, and leadership, as well as its commitment to providing high-quality support to the US government and military.
Here is a summary of the content:

The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief, and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record.

The court ruled that Draken's claims of unfair treatment are not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency is still in the pre-award evaluation stage of the procurement process. The outcome of the alleged unequal treatment has not yet occurred, and it cannot be ascertained until the agency selects an awardee.

Additionally, the court held that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, as bid protests are not within its jurisdiction. The court can only review the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

The court cited several cases, including NSK, Ltd. v. United States and Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, to support its decision.
The content appears to be a teaser or introduction to a premium article about Draken International, a leading name in contract Red Air support. The article is not available without an active subscription, but it seems to offer an in-depth look at the company's work.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private company that operates the world's largest private air force. Founded in 2011, the company has grown rapidly and currently undertakes training activities for the US military. Their fleet consists of various aircraft, including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s.

Draken International's business model is based on providing cost-effective solutions for military training exercises. They claim that their aircraft can operate at a significantly lower cost per hour than front-line military jets, with savings ranging from $40,000 to $80,000 per flight hour. Additionally, by using Draken's aircraft, the military can preserve the lifespan of their own fighter jets and avoid "negative training" scenarios.

The company is also looking to expand its operations to Europe, where they see growing demand for their services. They are currently in talks with several countries, including France, to establish a European base.

Draken International's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have adapted easily to flying the company's aircraft. The article highlights the unique nature of Draken's business, which allows retired fighter pilots to continue flying high-performance jets.

The other articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry, covering topics such as Airbus Defence & Space delivering a multi-role tanker transport, Bell performing the first flight of an upgraded CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies that provide adversary air services to support military training. These companies, such as Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), offer a range of services including Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are highly coveted, with estimated values of $6 billion over 10 years for the CAF ADAIR contract. The ASDOT contract is also expected to be lucrative, but its value has not been quantified.

The companies vying for these contracts have fleets of aircraft that range from older-generation jets like the F-5E and -F to more modern platforms like the F-16C and Gripen C. They are staffed by highly experienced aviators who can support deployed operations at multiple bases.

The key issues in the competition for these contracts will be affordability, with an estimated cost of $15,000 per flying hour, and the ability to provide a range of services across different aircraft capability categories. The contracts will likely require partnerships and the acquisition of new aircraft to meet the demand for flying hours.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government, particularly for military training and threat replication. The company is unique in its ability to offer significant cost savings to the government while providing high-quality training services.

Draken's fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s, sets it apart from other CAS providers. The company's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and buddy stores for refueling.

The company's aircrew and maintainers are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force personnel with extensive experience and training on specific airframes. This expertise ensures maximum safety, professionalism, and quality of service.

Draken operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, but also has a presence at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. The company's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and passion for aviation to the table.

The article suggests that Draken is well-positioned to sustain itself in the CAS market due to its commitment to infrastructure, logistics, and expertise. Additionally, the company sees potential for international expansion, particularly among NATO nations, as contract air services continue to grow globally.
The document is a court ruling in a bid protest case in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The plaintiff, Draken, is challenging the agency's evaluation process and alleging unequal treatment compared to other bidders. However, the court rules that the case is not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process is still uncertain.

The court cites previous cases, including NSK, Ltd. v. United States and Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, to support its decision. It concludes that Draken's claims are premature and that deciding not to review them does not impose any hardship on Draken.

Additionally, the court rules that it lacks jurisdiction to directly review the agency's protest decision, citing Honeywell, Inc. v. United States and MG Altus Apache Co. v. United States. The court can only review the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

Ultimately, the court denies Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief, while granting the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”). 
  
10 
  
Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which has grown rapidly since its formation in 2011. The company operates a fleet of advanced fighter jets, including MiG-21s and A-4s, and provides training services to the US military.

Draken's business model is based on providing cost-effective training solutions to the military, using older but still capable aircraft that can simulate real-world threats without the high operating costs of modern front-line fighters. The company's aircraft cost around $7,000 per hour to operate, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for modern military jets.

Draken's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have adapted easily to flying the company's aircraft. The company is now looking to expand its operations to Europe, where it sees growing demand for its services.

The article also mentions that Draken does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate advanced threats such as MiG-29s and J-11s. Instead, Draken focuses on simulating older third-generation and early fourth-generation aircraft types.

The other articles are unrelated to Draken International and appear to be separate news stories:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter it has upgraded under a modernisation programme for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies that offer adversary air and other aviation support services. These companies, such as Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and ATAC, provide contract-based airborne training services to military forces.

The US Air Force's Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK's Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are two major contracts up for grabs. These contracts require a range of services, including Red Air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) support, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The companies competing for these contracts have diverse fleets, including F-16s, F-5Es, Alphajets, and Mirages. They are staffed by experienced aviators who can support deployed operations from multiple bases.

The estimated contract value for the CAF ADAIR contract is $6 billion over 10 years, which works out to around $15,000 per flying hour. Affordability will be a key issue in the bidding process, and companies may need to form partnerships to meet the requirement for a large number of flying hours.

The article concludes that there are interesting times ahead in the adversary air market, with opportunities for companies to provide innovative solutions to meet military training needs.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. The company's fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, Macchi MB-339s, and MiG-21s, makes it the largest privately-owned fleet in the world.

Draken International differentiates itself from other CAS providers through its aircraft capabilities, organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices. The company's A-4K Skyhawks have undergone a several hundred million dollar upgrade program to include radar, avionics, and data bus capabilities similar to those found in F-16s.

The company provides a range of services, including "red air" adversary support, JTAC training, and research and development testing. Draken International's pilots are full-time employees trained on one airframe, increasing safety and professionalism.

The company is headquartered in Lakeland, Florida, but also operates from facilities at Mojave Air and Spaceport in California. Draken International's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings a strong business background and passion for aviation to the company.

Draken International plans to sustain itself through its commitment to building and maintaining a robust infrastructure to support its fleet of aircraft. The company believes it has put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the US government and taxpayers.

Finally, Draken International sees potential in providing its services outside the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, particularly among NATO nations.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has ruled in favor of the defendant and intervenor, denying the plaintiff's (Draken) motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief. The court found that Draken's claims were not ripe for judicial review because the agency had not yet made a final decision on the procurement.

The court cited precedents stating that a claim is not ripe for review until the agency has completed its decision-making process, which in this case would be after the award of the contract. The court also found that Draken did not suffer any hardship by withholding consideration of their claims, as the alleged unequal treatment had not yet occurred.

Additionally, the court ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest decision, but rather reviews the underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions. The plaintiff's challenge to the agency's protest decision was rejected without evaluating the agency protest decision.

The court granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida. The company was formed in 2011 and has grown rapidly since then. It operates a fleet of fighter jets, including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s, which are used for military training and simulation purposes.

The company's business model is to provide low-cost flight hours to militaries around the world, allowing them to train their pilots more efficiently and cost-effectively. Draken International's aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour to operate, compared to $40,000 an hour for a front-line military jet like an F-16.

The company's pilots are all ex-military, with experience flying fighter jets. They are trained on the specific aircraft they will be flying, and the company has developed a reputation for being able to simulate a wide range of threats, from third-generation MiG-21s to early fourth-generation fighters.

Draken International is currently working with the US military, but it is also looking to expand its operations into Europe. The company believes that there is growing demand for its services in the region, and it is in talks with several countries about opening a European base.

The article also mentions that Draken International does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which fly advanced fighter jets like the F-15, F-18, and F-16. Instead, the company focuses on simulating threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft, which are more cost-effective to operate.

The other articles appear to be unrelated news briefs about the aviation industry, including a delivery of an Airbus A330-based tanker transport to a multinational unit in the Netherlands, a first flight of a Bell CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and a quarterly profit report from Mesa Air Group.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the growing demand for commercial air support contracts. Several companies are vying for these lucrative contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies offer a range of services, including adversary air, joint terminal air control (JTAC) training, electronic warfare (EW) training, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are among the most lucrative prizes in this field. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with an operating cost of around $15,000 per flying hour. This is significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C, but more than the likely operating costs of some older-generation aircraft.

The companies bidding for these contracts have experienced and qualified staff, including former military pilots. They also have a range of aircraft at their disposal, including upgraded F-5s, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s. Some companies are also teamed up with other organizations to bid for the contracts, such as Top Aces' partnership with Leonardo and Inzpire.

The article concludes that affordability will be a key issue in these contracts, but there will likely be a role for aircraft with more sophisticated capabilities than those currently available. The demand for these services is expected to be high, with 37,000 flying hours per year required for the ADAIR contract alone. This may lead to partnerships and collaborations between companies to meet the demand.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government, particularly in the area of tactical fighter jets. Here are the main points:

* Draken International is the largest player in the CAS market, with over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.
* The company's aircraft have undergone significant upgrades, including the installation of APG-66 radars and radar warning receivers (RWRs), making them highly capable and realistic adversaries for US military training.
* Draken International's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense, and JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) training.
* The company has a strong infrastructure and logistics in place, with a commitment to safety, professionalism, and customer service.
* Draken International is led by Jared Isaacman, who brings business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company. His leadership has helped the company execute a "Field of Dreams" strategy, building an impressive fleet and infrastructure to support it.
* The company plans to sustain itself through its commitment to maintaining its fleet and providing high-quality services to the US government.
* Draken International sees potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces, particularly in NATO nations.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's unique capabilities and strengths in the CAS market, as well as its leadership's vision for the company's future.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief in a bid protest case. The court ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest, as it is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions.

The court also found that the issue of unequal treatment raised by Draken was not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process is still uncertain. The court cited a previous case, Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where it recognized that a proposed site selection was not ripe for judicial review due to uncertainties over the transfer of property and funding.

The court further held that withholding consideration of Draken's claim would not cause hardship, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken. The court granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and the intervenor's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.

In essence, the court declined to review the agency's protest decision and denied Draken's motions, directing the clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida. The company was formed in 2011 and has grown rapidly since then. It operates a fleet of fighter jets, including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s, which are used to provide training services to military forces.

Draken International's business model is based on providing cost-effective training solutions to military customers. The company's aircraft are significantly cheaper to operate than front-line military jets, with an hourly operating cost of around $7,000 compared to $40,000-$80,000 for an F-16 or F-35. This allows Draken International to offer significant cost savings to its customers.

The company's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have experience flying fighter jets. The company is actively looking at opening a European base and is in conversations with several potential customers.

Draken International does not provide high-end training services, such as those provided by US Aggressor units, but instead focuses on simulating third-generation or early fourth-generation threats. The company's pilots are able to adapt quickly to flying different types of aircraft, including the A-4 and MB-339.

The article also mentions that Draken International's business is driven by the growing demand for cost-effective training solutions, as military forces around the world face budget constraints.

The other articles on the page appear to be unrelated news briefs about the aviation industry. They include a report on Airbus Defence & Space delivering an A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport to a multinational unit in the Netherlands, Bell performing the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the growing market for commercial air support contracts, specifically in the areas of adversary air and operational training. Several companies are vying for these lucrative contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC).

These companies offer a range of services, including Red Air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. They have fleets of various aircraft, including F-16s, F-5Es, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are two of the most lucrative prizes in this market. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with an estimated cost of $15,000 per flying hour.

The article suggests that affordability will be a key issue in these contracts, and that there may be opportunities for partnerships between companies to meet the requirements. Additionally, it notes that some companies are actively marketing advanced aircraft, such as the Gripen C and M-346, to meet high-end adversary air requirements.

Overall, the market for commercial air support contracts is highly competitive, with several experienced and well-qualified companies vying for these lucrative deals.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. The company is differentiated from others in the space by its large fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s. These aircraft have been upgraded with advanced capabilities, such as radar and avionics, making them suitable for a range of services including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, and chase services.

Draken's pilots and maintainers are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force personnel who have been hired for their specific expertise. The company has found talent through its strong infrastructure and logistics, as well as its commitment to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel.

The company is headquartered in Lakeland, Florida, but also operates from facilities at BAE System's facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken's leadership team, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company. The company has executed a strategy it calls "Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come," which involves purchasing high-quality jets and building an infrastructure to support them.

Draken believes it can sustain itself in the CAS market by offering a range of services and having a commitment to sustaining its aircraft over many years. The company also sees potential for providing its services outside the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, particularly among NATO nations.
Here is a summary of the content:

The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief in a bid protest case. The court ruled that Draken's claims of unfair treatment are not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee, and therefore, any potential harm to Draken is speculative.

The court cited precedent from NSK, Ltd. v. United States (2007) and Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium (Fed. Cl. 2013), which held that a proposed site selection was not ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of property had not been concluded.

Additionally, the court ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest decision, as an agency protest is not a procurement action within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).

The court granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and Intervenor's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private company that operates a large fleet of military aircraft, including MiG-21s, Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, and Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros. The company provides training services to the US military, simulating threats from third-generation and early fourth-generation aircraft. Draken's pilots are mostly ex-military personnel who have adapted quickly to flying the company's aircraft.

The article highlights the cost-effectiveness of using Draken's services, with hourly flight costs significantly lower than those of front-line military jets. Additionally, every hour flown by Draken's aircraft reduces the wear and tear on military airframes, increasing their lifespan.

Draken is also exploring the possibility of opening a European base to meet growing demand for its services. The company does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units but focuses on simulating threats from older generation aircraft.

The article concludes with quotes from Draken's CEO, emphasizing the importance of real-flight experience for pilots and the limitations of simulator training.

The other three articles are brief news updates:

1. Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
2. Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
3. Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to recover financially.
The article discusses the growing demand for commercial air support contracts, particularly in the US and UK. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are seen as lucrative opportunities, but there will be stiff competition from various providers.

Several companies are offering adversary air and other aviation support services, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies have experienced staff and a range of aircraft fleets, including F-16s, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s.

The contracts require a range of services, including Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. The estimated contract value for the CAF US is $6 billion over 10 years, working out to around $15,000 per flying hour.

Affordability will be a key issue in the contracts, but there will also be a demand for more sophisticated aircraft across various capability categories. This could lead to partnerships and opportunities for companies to acquire and modify new aircraft to meet the requirements.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. Here are the key points:

* Delays in the F-35 program have increased demand for legacy fighter jets, making Draken's fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including A-4K Skyhawks, F-16s, and F-18s, highly valuable.
* Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and data bus, making them ideal for adversary support, research and development, and other missions.
* The company provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, JTAC training, and R&D mission sets.
* Draken's infrastructure and logistics are designed to support high sortie rates, with a focus on safety and professionalism.
* The company plans to operate from facilities outside its Lakeland headquarters, with two A-4Ks already based at BAE Systems' facility in Mojave Air and Spaceport.
* Jared Isaacman brings business savvy and passion for aviation to the company, which has executed a "Field of Dreams" strategy by building an infrastructure to support its fleet.
* Draken aims to sustain itself through its commitment to its aircraft and infrastructure, unlike other firms that have come and gone in this space.
* The company sees potential in providing its services outside the US to foreign air forces, particularly across NATO nations.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's unique capabilities and approach to providing commercial air services to the US military.
The document is a court decision in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The plaintiff, Draken, had filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record and a motion for injunctive relief, challenging the agency's evaluation process and protesting the denial of its bid protest. However, the court denies both motions and grants the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record.

The court rules that the case is not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee, and therefore, it cannot be determined whether Draken will be treated unfairly or prejudicially compared to other bidders. The court cites previous cases, including NSK, Ltd. v. United States and Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, which held that a proposed site selection was not ripe for judicial review due to uncertainty over the transfer of property and funding.

The court also notes that withholding consideration of Draken's claims will not cause hardship to the plaintiff, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.

Furthermore, the court rules that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's protest decision, as it is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions. The court can only review the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

In conclusion, the court denies Draken's motions and grants the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them. Interesting times ahead. – Dim Jones  Originally published in MS&T Issue 3, 2018.    Bringing together leaders in airline training to share knowledge, talent, and experience.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.

“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which operates a fleet of advanced fighter jets, including MiG-21s, Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, and MB-339 trainers. The company provides military training services to the US military, simulating real-world threats to help prepare pilots for combat.

Draken International's aircraft cost around $7,000 per hour to operate, significantly cheaper than front-line military jets, which can cost up to $80,000 per hour. This allows the company to provide cost-effective training solutions while also helping to extend the life of military aircraft by reducing their usage.

The company is actively looking to expand its operations to Europe, where there is growing demand for its services. Draken International's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have been trained on the company's fleet of aircraft.

The article highlights the unique nature of Draken International's business model, which fills a niche in the military training market by providing realistic threat simulation at a lower cost than traditional methods.

The other articles mentioned appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies that provide adversary air and other aviation support services. These companies, such as Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), offer a range of services including Red Air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The companies are competing for lucrative commercial air support contracts, such as the US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with an operating cost of around $15,000 per flying hour.

The companies are staffed by highly experienced and qualified aviators, and have fleets of aircraft that can meet the required performance categories, ranging from subsonic to supersonic. The contracts will require a significant number of flying hours, which may necessitate partnerships between bidders to acquire, modify, and operate the necessary aircraft.

The article suggests that affordability will be a key issue in the competition for these contracts, but also notes that there will be a demand for more sophisticated aircraft that can meet the high-end adversary air requirements.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. The company owns over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, Macchi MB-339s, and MiG-21s, making it the largest privately-owned fleet in the world.

Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities, such as radar and avionics, which sets them apart from other CAS providers. The company's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and chase services.

The article highlights the unique value proposition of Draken International, including:

* Unmatched aircraft capabilities and infrastructure
* Expert pilots and maintenance personnel
* Indigenous supply line ensuring maximum sortie rates
* Commitment to safety, professionalism, and customer service

Draken's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and passion for aviation to the company. The article suggests that Draken is well-positioned to sustain itself in the CAS market due to its investment in infrastructure and personnel.

Finally, the article mentions that Draken sees potential in providing its services outside of CONUS (continental United States) to foreign air forces, particularly among NATO nations.
The document appears to be a court decision in a bid protest case involving Draken, an interested party that objected to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals. The Court of Federal Claims denied Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and motion for injunctive relief, and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record.

The court ruled that Draken's claims were not yet ripe for judicial review because the Agency was still in the pre-award evaluation stage of the procurement process. The court cited case law stating that a proposed site selection is not fit for judicial review until the agency selects an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process is known.

The court also held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the Agency's denial of Draken's protest, as the Court of Federal Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the GAO. Instead, the court reviews the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The article focuses on Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which is considered the world's largest private air force. Founded in 2011, the company has grown to operate a fleet of fighter jets and other aircraft, providing training and simulation services to military forces.

Draken International's fleet includes A-4 Skyhawks, F-16s, and MiG-21s, among others. The company's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have been trained to fly these aircraft. Draken International provides a range of services, including threat simulation, aggressor training, and air-to-air combat training.

The company's business model is based on providing cost-effective solutions to military forces, which can save millions of dollars by using Draken International's services instead of flying their own front-line fighter jets. The company's aircraft cost around $7,000 per hour to operate, compared to $40,000 per hour for an F-16 or $80,000 per hour for an F-35.

Draken International is currently working with the US military, but it is also exploring opportunities in Europe and other regions. The company is looking to establish a European base of operations and has been in talks with several countries, including France.

The article also mentions that Draken International does not provide high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate advanced threats using F-15s, F-18s, and F-16s. Instead, Draken International focuses on simulating third-generation and early fourth-generation aircraft threats.

Finally, the article notes that Draken International's pilots are drawn from ex-military ranks, with many having previously flown A-4s and F-16s. The company's training program includes instruction on flying MiG-21s, which requires specialized expertise due to the lack of experience with these aircraft in the US.

The other articles mentioned appear to be unrelated news briefs about Airbus Defence & Space delivering an A330-200-based tanker transport to a multinational unit, Bell performing the first flight of a modernized CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the growing demand for commercial air support contracts. Several companies are vying for these lucrative contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies offer a range of services, including adversary air, joint terminal air control training, electronic warfare training, unmanned aerial vehicle testing, and air traffic control training.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are two of the most lucrative prizes in this market. However, there are several other companies also bidding for these contracts, each with their own fleet of aircraft and expertise.

The article highlights the estimated value of the CAF ADAIR contract at $6 billion over 10 years, which works out to around $15,000 per flying hour. This is significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C, but more than the operating costs of some older-generation aircraft.

Affordability will be a key issue in these contracts, and the requirement for a range of aircraft capabilities suggests that there will be a role for both sophisticated and less capable aircraft. The article concludes that partnerships may also play a significant role in meeting the demand for flying hours, which is estimated to be around 37,000 hours per year.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. Here are the main points:

* Draken International is the largest player in the CAS market, with over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.
* The company's aircraft have undergone significant upgrades, including the installation of APG-66 radars and RWRs, making them highly capable and tactically relevant adversaries for military training.
* Draken's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) training, and more.
* The company has a strong infrastructure and logistics in place to support its operations, including a commitment to safety, professionalism, and customer service.
* Draken operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, as well as from facilities at Mojave Air and Spaceport in California.
* The company's leadership, including Jared Isaacman, brings a combination of business savvy, passion for aviation, and tactical experience to the table.
* Draken aims to sustain itself through its commitment to building and maintaining a highly capable fleet, as well as its indigenous supply line, which ensures maximum sortie rates.
* The company sees potential in providing its services outside CONUS (Continental United States) to foreign air forces, particularly among NATO nations.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's unique capabilities and commitment to providing high-quality commercial air services to the US military.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied a motion for judgment and injunctive relief filed by Draken, a plaintiff in a bid protest case. The court ruled that the case was not ripe for judicial review because the agency's decision-making process had not yet been completed.

Draken argued that it would be treated unfairly compared to other bidders if its concerns were not addressed, but the court found that this claim was speculative and could not be ascertained until the agency selects an awardee. The court cited a previous case, Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was deemed not ripe for judicial review due to uncertainty over the transfer of property and Congressional funding.

The court also declined to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest, as it lacked jurisdiction to directly review protest decisions. Instead, the court reviews the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record. The clerk was directed to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them. Interesting times ahead. – Dim Jones  Originally published in MS&T Issue 3, 2018.    Bringing together leaders in airline training to share knowledge, talent, and experience.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.

have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.

“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private company that operates a fleet of fighter jets, including MiG-21s, Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, and Aero Vodochody L-39s. The company provides training services to military forces, simulating real-world threats without the high cost of using front-line fighter jets.

Draken International's CEO highlights the cost savings of using their aircraft, which are around $7,000 per hour, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for a front-line fighter jet. The company also emphasizes the benefits of extending the life expectancy of military aircraft by flying training missions on older planes.

The company is looking to expand its operations to Europe and is in talks with several countries, including France, where they could provide threat simulation services using their L-39s. Draken International's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have adapted easily to flying the company's aircraft.

The article also mentions that the company does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate advanced threats using F-15s, F-18s, and F-16s. Instead, Draken International focuses on simulating third-generation or early fourth-generation threats, such as MiG-21s.

The remaining articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered an A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are two lucrative opportunities that multiple providers, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), are expected to bid on.

These companies offer a range of services, including Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. They have fleets comprising various aircraft types, such as F-16s, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s, which are being upgraded with modern avionics to meet customer requirements.

The contracts will require a significant number of flying hours, estimated at 37,000 per year for the CAF ADAIR contract, which could lead to partnerships between bidders. The operating costs of these aircraft are expected to be around $15,000 per hour, significantly less than the cost of an F-16C but more than older-generation aircraft.

The article concludes that affordability will be a key issue, and there will be a demand for aircraft with varying levels of capability across the spectrum, from subsonic to supersonic. The contract is expected to begin in 2019, allowing time for bidders to locate, acquire, modify, and obtain clearance for new aircraft, as well as train aircrew and maintainers to support them.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government, particularly the military. The company owns over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s, which are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and buddy store refueling tanks.

Draken International differentiates itself from other firms in the CAS market through its organizational infrastructure, financial resources, maintenance practices, and aircraft capabilities. The company provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and R&D mission sets.

The company's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and aviation experience to the table. Draken International has executed a strategy called "Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come," which involves building an infrastructure to support its aircraft and expertise.

Draken International plans to sustain itself through its commitment to purchasing and maintaining its fleet of aircraft, as well as its indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. The company also sees potential in providing its services outside the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, particularly in NATO nations.

Overall, Draken International is positioning itself as a leading provider of commercial air services to the US government and military, with a focus on sustainability, infrastructure, and expertise.
The document is a court decision from the United States Court of Federal Claims. The plaintiff, Draken, had filed a motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief in a bid protest case. The court denied both motions and granted the defendant's (the Agency) motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.

The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, as it is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The court also found that the alleged unequal treatment of Draken compared to other bidders was not ripe for judicial review because the outcome had not yet occurred and the Agency was still in the pre-award evaluation stage.

The court cited several cases, including NSK, Ltd. v. United States, Texas Bio-& Agro-Defense Consortium, and Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc., to support its decision. The court concluded that withholding consideration of Draken's claims would not harm the plaintiff, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.

Ultimately, the court denied all of Draken's motions and granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.

 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which operates a fleet of fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft, including MiG-21s, Douglas A-4s, and MB-339s. The company provides training services to the US military, simulating threats from third-generation and early fourth-generation aircraft at a lower cost than using front-line fighter jets.

The article highlights several key points about Draken International:

* The company's aircraft cost around $7,000 per hour to operate, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for front-line fighter jets.
* By using older aircraft, the US military can save flight hours on their more advanced jets and reduce the risk of "negative training" (using valuable flight time for unnecessary missions).
* Draken International is looking to expand its services to Europe, with potential bases in countries such as France.
* The company's pilots are all ex-military personnel, who are able to adapt quickly to flying the A-4s and MB-339s. However, finding pilots with experience on the MiG-21s has been more challenging.

The article also mentions that Draken International does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate more advanced threats using F-15s, F-18s, and F-16s.

The other three articles appear to be unrelated news briefs:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered an A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the rise of private companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are among the most lucrative prizes in this field.

Several companies, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), are competing for these contracts. These companies have experienced staff, advanced aircraft fleets, and offer a range of services beyond pure Red Air, such as Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The contracts require a high level of aircraft capability, with the CAF ADAIR draft RFP specifying three categories of aircraft performance, ranging from subsonic to supersonic. Meeting these requirements at an affordable price will be challenging, but companies like Saab and Leonardo are actively marketing versions of their Gripen C and M-346 jets to meet high-end adversary air requirements.

The estimated contract values for the CAF US ADAIR contract is around $6 billion over 10 years, which works out to approximately $15,000 per flying hour. This is significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C, but more than some older-generation aircraft in the competing contractors' fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, and partnerships may be necessary to meet the requirements.

The article concludes that there will be stiff competition for these lucrative contracts, and companies will need to balance affordability with capability to succeed.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government, specifically in the area of tactical fighter jets. The company's unique selling point is its large fleet of over 50 privately-owned tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.

Draken International differentiates itself from other firms in this space through its organizational infrastructure, financial resources, maintenance practices, and aircraft capabilities. The company's A-4K Skyhawks have undergone a several hundred million dollar upgrade program to include advanced radar, avionics, and data bus capabilities, making them tactically relevant adversaries with generation 4+ capabilities.

The company provides services such as adversary air support, JTAC training, and R&D test support. Draken International's pilots are full-time experts on specific airframes, increasing safety, professionalism, and customer satisfaction.

The company operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, but also has aircraft stationed at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken International's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company.

Unlike other firms that have come and gone, Draken International plans to sustain itself through its commitment to building an unbeatable infrastructure, expertise, and supply line to support its aircraft. The company sees potential in providing its services outside of the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces in the future.
The document is a court decision in the United States Court of Federal Claims, where Draken, a plaintiff, has filed a motion for judgment on an administrative record and injunctive relief against the defendant, a federal agency. The court denies Draken's motions and grants the defendant's and intervenor's motions.

The main issues are:

1. Ripeness: The court finds that Draken's claim of unfair treatment is not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet made an award in the procurement process.
2. Hardship: The court determines that withholding consideration of Draken's claim will not cause hardship to Draken, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.
3. Agency Protest Decision: The court lacks jurisdiction to review the agency's protest decision and can only review the underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

The court concludes that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's protest decision and denies Draken's motions. The defendant's and intervenor's motions are granted, and the clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which has grown rapidly since its formation in 2011. The company operates a fleet of 30 aircraft, including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s, and provides military training services to the US military.

The company's business model is based on offering cost-effective alternatives to military aircraft for training purposes. Draken International claims that its aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour to operate, compared to $40,000 per hour for a front-line fighter jet like the F-16. Additionally, by using older aircraft, Draken International can help extend the life of military airframes and reduce the risk of "negative training" where pilots waste valuable flight time on missions that are not relevant to real-world scenarios.

The company is looking to expand its operations to Europe, where it sees growing demand for its services. Draken International's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have adapted quickly to flying the company's aircraft. The article notes that while simulators are becoming increasingly sophisticated, there is no substitute for actual flight experience when it comes to training military pilots.

The other articles on the page appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry, including stories about Airbus Defence & Space delivering a tanker transport aircraft, Bell performing the first flight of an upgraded CH-146 Griffon helicopter, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies that provide adversary air and other aviation support services. These companies, such as Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), offer a range of services including Red Air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The companies are competing for lucrative contracts such as the US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with an operating cost of around $15,000 per flying hour.

The companies are staffed by experienced aviators and have fleets of various aircraft, including F-16s, F-5Es, L-39 Albatros, and Mirage F1s. Some companies are also partnering with other organizations to bid for the contracts.

The article suggests that affordability will be a key issue in the competition, but notes that there will be a role for more sophisticated aircraft across the full spectrum of capability categories. The contract is expected to begin in 2019, and it may require partnerships between bidders to meet the demand for flying hours and aircraft.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. The company's fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s, sets it apart from other firms in the industry. Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and data bus, making them tactically relevant adversaries for military training.

The company's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and chase services. Draken is also the only CAS provider that offers air-to-air refueling capabilities.

Draken's leadership team has a strong background in tactical aviation, with CEO Jared Isaacman bringing business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company. The company's strategy, dubbed "Field of Dreams," involves building an infrastructure to support its fleet and providing maximum sortie rates.

Unlike other firms that have come and gone, Draken plans to sustain itself through its commitment to purchasing and maintaining its own aircraft, rather than leasing them. The company also sees potential for international expansion, particularly among NATO nations.

Overall, Draken International is positioning itself as a leading provider of commercial air services to the US government, with a focus on providing high-quality training and support to military forces.
Here is a summary of the content:

The United States Court of Federal Claims has ruled on a motion for judgment on an administrative record and a motion for injunctive relief filed by Draken, a plaintiff in a bid protest case. The court denied both motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record.

The court held that Draken's claim of unequal treatment compared to other bidders is not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process is still uncertain. The court cited a previous case, Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where it was held that a proposed site selection was not fit for judicial review due to uncertainty over the transfer of property.

The court also held that it does not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, as it is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions. The court's role is to review the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions, directing the clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, which operates a fleet of 30 MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, and other aircraft. The company provides threat simulation services to the US military, flying aircraft that can mimic the performance of enemy planes.

Draken International's CEO explains that their aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour to operate, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for front-line military jets. This significant cost savings allows the company to provide valuable training services to the military without expending precious flight hours on expensive fighter aircraft.

The company is also exploring opportunities to open a European base, where they can offer their services to other military forces. Draken International's pilots are all ex-military, and they have developed expertise in flying a range of aircraft types.

The article also mentions that the company does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate advanced threats such as MiG-29s and J-11s. Instead, Draken International focuses on simulating third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft threats.

The remaining articles are brief news updates from the aviation industry:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to recover financially.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the growing demand for commercial air support contracts. Several companies, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and ATAC (Airborne Tactical Advantage Company), are competing for these lucrative contracts.

These companies offer a range of services, including adversary air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. They have diverse fleets of aircraft, including F-16s, Alphajets, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawks, IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets, and others.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are among the most lucrative prizes. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with a flying hour cost of around $15,000.

The companies competing for these contracts have highly experienced and qualified staff, including multi-qualified aviators who are also current military flying practitioners. They are set up to support deployed operations, with multiple operating bases across the US and elsewhere.

Affordability will be a key issue in the competition, but the overall requirement will likely span the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role for more sophisticated aircraft. Partnerships may also play a significant role in meeting the contract requirements.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. Here are the main points:

* Draken International is the largest player in the CAS market, with over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.
* The company's aircraft have undergone significant upgrades, including the installation of APG-66 radars and radar warning receivers (RWRs), making them highly capable and tactically relevant.
* Draken International provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, and JTAC training, among others.
* The company's pilots are full-time employees trained on specific airframes, ensuring safety, professionalism, and high-quality service.
* Draken International plans to operate from facilities other than its Lakeland headquarters, with two A-4Ks already based at BAE System's facility in Mojave Air and Spaceport.
* The company's leadership, including Isaacman, brings business savvy and a passion for aviation, which has helped the company build an "unbelievable infrastructure" to support its aircraft.
* Draken International aims to sustain itself by offering high-quality services and maintaining its fleet of aircraft, unlike other firms in the space that have come and gone.
* The company sees potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces, particularly across NATO nations.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's unique capabilities, infrastructure, and leadership, which position it as a key player in the commercial air services market.
The document appears to be a court decision in a bid protest case involving Draken, an interested party, and a federal agency. The court is denying Draken's motions for judgment on the administrative record and injunctive relief, and instead granting the defendant's and intervenor's motions.

The court finds that Draken's claims of unequal treatment are not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process is still uncertain. The court cites precedent from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the Court of Federal Claims, holding that a proposed site selection or procurement decision is not fit for judicial review until the agency's decision-making process is complete.

The court also finds that it lacks jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest decision, as the Court of Federal Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Instead, the court reviews the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

The court concludes that Draken has not demonstrated any hardship or prejudice from withholding consideration of its claims, and therefore denies its motions. The defendant's and intervenor's motions are granted, and the clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”). 
  
10 
  
Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private company that operates the world's largest private air force. Founded in 2011, the company has grown rapidly and now has a fleet of aircraft including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s. The company provides training services to military forces, simulating enemy threats using its fleet of aircraft.

The company's business model is based on providing cost-effective training solutions to military forces. By using older generation fighter jets, Draken International can offer flight hours at a significantly lower cost than modern frontline fighter jets. Additionally, the company argues that using older aircraft for training purposes helps to prolong the life of newer, more expensive aircraft.

The company's pilots are all ex-military and have experience flying similar aircraft. The company is currently focused on providing services to the US military but is exploring opportunities to expand into Europe.

The article also mentions that Draken International does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, which simulate advanced threats using modern fighter jets. Instead, Draken International focuses on simulating third-generation and early fourth-generation threats.

The remaining articles are unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter it has upgraded under a modernisation programme for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the emergence of private companies that offer adversary air and other aviation support services. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are up for grabs, with several companies vying for the lucrative deals.

Companies mentioned include Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), which have fleets of various aircraft, including F-16s, F-5s, L-39 Albatros, and Mirage F1s. These companies are staffed by experienced aviators and are set up to support deployed operations.

The article highlights the challenges of meeting the performance requirements of these contracts, particularly at an affordable price. The estimated contract value for the CAF ADAIR contract is $6 billion over 10 years, which works out to around $15,000 per flying hour. This is significantly less than the operating cost of an F-16C, but more than some older-generation aircraft.

The article concludes that affordability will be a key issue, and there may be scope for partnerships between companies to meet the requirements of these contracts. The demand for sophisticated aircraft and the need for budget headroom to acquire and operate them are also highlighted.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. The company owns over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Macchi MB-339s, making it the largest privately-owned fleet in the world.

Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and data bus, which sets them apart from other CAS providers. The company offers a range of services including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and chase services.

Draken's pilots are full-time pilots trained on one airframe, ensuring expertise and professionalism in their services. The company operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, but also has facilities at Mojave Air and Spaceport in California.

The article highlights Draken's unique approach to CAS, which involves investing in the best aircraft and infrastructure to support them, rather than simply leasing a few jets with little support behind them. This strategy has allowed the company to sustain itself and provide valuable services to the US military.

Draken also sees potential for expansion outside of the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, as contract air services continue to grow globally.
Here is a summary of the court decision:

The plaintiff, Draken, filed a motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief, alleging that the agency's evaluation process was unfair and prejudicial. The court denied both motions.

The court ruled that the issue of unequal treatment was not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency had not yet selected an awardee, and therefore, it was unclear whether Draken would be treated unfairly compared to other bidders. The court cited a previous case, Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was not considered ripe for review because negotiations over the transfer of property had not been concluded.

The court also held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, as the Court of Federal Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the GAO.

Finally, the court granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record, directing the Clerk to enter judgment accordingly.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.

 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida. The company was formed in 2011 and has grown rapidly since then. It operates a fleet of aircraft, including MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s, which are used to provide training and threat simulation services to military forces.

The article highlights the cost-effectiveness of Draken's services, with hourly operating costs ranging from $7,000 to $40,000 per hour, compared to front-line military jets which can cost up to $80,000 per hour. The company also emphasizes the importance of preserving the life expectancy of military aircraft by reducing flight hours and providing training on less expensive platforms.

Draken's pilots are drawn from ex-military ranks, and the company has established relationships with other organizations, such as Aerostar in Romania, to provide guidance and support for its operations. The article also mentions that Draken is actively looking at opening a European base to meet growing demand for its services.

The other articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry, including deliveries of Airbus A330-200 tankers, Bell CH-146 Griffon helicopter upgrades, and financial reports from Mesa Air Group.
The article discusses the growing market for commercial air support contracts, particularly in the US and UK. The US Air Force's Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK's Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are seen as lucrative opportunities for companies providing adversary air and other aviation support services.

Several companies are mentioned as potential bidders for these contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies have experienced staff and a range of aircraft in their fleets, including F-16s, F-5Es, and Mirage F1s.

The contracts require providers to offer a range of services, including Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. The aircraft used must meet specific performance requirements, ranging from subsonic to supersonic capabilities.

The estimated contract values are significant, with the CAF ADAIR contract valued at $6 billion over 10 years. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement is expected to spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role for both high-end and older-generation aircraft.

The article concludes that interesting times are ahead in this market, with opportunities for partnerships and the development of new capabilities.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. Here are the main points:

* Draken International is the largest player in the CAS market, with over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Macchi MB-339s.
* The company's fleet is unmatched in terms of capabilities, with advanced radar and avionics systems, making them ideal for adversary support and threat replication training.
* Draken International provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and R&D mission sets.
* The company's pilots are full-time experts on specific airframes, ensuring safety, professionalism, and high-quality service to customers.
* Draken International operates from its headquarters in Lakeland, Florida, but also has a presence at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport.
* CEO Jared Isaacman brings business savvy and passion for aviation to the company, with a commitment to building an unbeatable infrastructure to support its fleet.
* The company's strategy is to build a top-notch capability and wait for customers to come, rather than trying to lease aircraft with limited support.
* Draken International sees potential in providing its services outside the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, particularly among NATO nations.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied a motion for judgment and injunctive relief filed by Draken, a plaintiff in a bid protest case. The court ruled that the case was not ripe for judicial review because the agency had not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process was uncertain.

Draken claimed that it would be treated unfairly compared to other bidders, but the court found that this allegation was premature and could not be ascertained until the agency selects an awardee. The court cited a previous case, Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was not ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of property to the agency had not been concluded.

The court also declined to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest, as it does not have jurisdiction to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the GAO. The court only has jurisdiction to review procurement actions, such as a solicitation for bids or an award of a contract.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them. Interesting times ahead. – Dim Jones  Originally published in MS&T Issue 3, 2018.    Bringing together leaders in airline training to share knowledge, talent, and experience.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The article primarily focuses on Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida. Founded in 2011, Draken has rapidly grown to become the world's largest private air force, with a fleet of aircraft including A-4s, MiG-21s, and MB-339s.

The company provides threat simulation services to the US military, flying missions that mimic real-world threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft. This allows the military to train against realistic opponents without using expensive front-line fighter jets.

Draken's aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour to operate, compared to $40,000 per hour for an F-16 and $80,000 per hour for an F-35. Additionally, every hour flown by Draken's aircraft extends the life of military jets, which have a limited number of flight hours before they need to be retired.

The company is actively looking to open a European base, where it can provide similar services to European militaries. Draken's pilots are all ex-military, and the company has found that its A-4s and MB-339s are easy for pilots to adapt to. However, finding pilots with experience on MiG-21s was more challenging, but they were able to receive guidance from Aerostar in Romania.

The article also briefly mentions other aviation news, including Airbus Defence & Space delivering an A330-200-based tanker transport to a multinational unit, Bell performing the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and Mesa Air Group posting its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years.
The article discusses the growing market for commercial air support contracts, particularly in the areas of adversary air and operational training. The US Air Force's Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK's Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are highlighted as lucrative opportunities.

Several companies are vying for these contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies offer a range of services, including Red Air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The article notes that affordability will be a key issue in the bidding process, with estimated contract values ranging from $15,000 per flying hour for the CAF ADAIR contract to potentially higher costs for more sophisticated aircraft. The contracts are expected to require a significant number of flying hours, which may lead to partnerships and collaborations between bidders.

The companies involved have impressive fleets of aircraft, including F-16s, F-5Es, Alphajets, and Mirages, among others. They also boast experienced and qualified staff, with some aviators holding current military flying practice.

Overall, the article suggests that the market for commercial air support contracts is heating up, with several companies poised to bid on lucrative contracts in the coming years.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government, particularly to the Air Force and Navy. The company differentiates itself from others in this space through its large fleet of over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.

Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities such as radar, avionics, and data bus, making them tactically relevant adversaries for training purposes. The company's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) training, and chase services.

The article highlights Draken's commitment to infrastructure and logistics, as well as its personnel, who are full-time pilots trained on one airframe each. This approach increases safety, professionalism, and service quality for customers.

Draken's leadership is credited with bringing business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company. The CEO, Jared Isaacman, has thousands of hours of flying experience and motivates his team to perform at their best.

The article notes that Draken's strategy of building a strong infrastructure and fleet has allowed it to sustain itself in the market, unlike other firms that have come and gone. Additionally, Draken sees potential for expansion into international markets, particularly among NATO nations.

Overall, the article presents Draken International as a leading provider of commercial air services to the US government, with a unique value proposition based on its fleet, infrastructure, personnel, and leadership.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied a plaintiff's (Draken) motion for judgment on an administrative record and injunctive relief in a bid protest case. The court ruled that the issue of unequal treatment is not yet ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee, and any potential harm to Draken cannot be ascertained until then.

The court also declined to review the agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, citing a lack of jurisdiction to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Instead, the court reviews the agency's underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions.

The court concluded that withholding consideration of Draken's claims would not cause hardship, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken. The court granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record and directed the clerk to enter judgment accordingly.
The content appears to be a teaser or introduction to an article about Draken International, a leading company in contract Red Air support. However, the full article requires an active subscription to access. The text also includes promotional language encouraging readers to become members and subscribe to Key Military for military news and expert analysis.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

 Key Publishing Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 2713662. VAT No. GB445558329.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private air force company based in Lakeland, Florida, that provides training services to the US military. The company has a fleet of 30 operational MiG-21s, A-4s, and MB-339s, which are used to simulate threats for military training exercises.

Draken International's business model is centered around providing cost-effective training solutions to the military. By using older aircraft that are less expensive to operate than modern fighter jets, Draken can offer significant cost savings to its clients. The company estimates that it costs around $7,000 per hour to operate its aircraft, compared to $40,000-$80,000 per hour for a front-line military jet.

The company's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have experience flying similar aircraft. Draken is also exploring the possibility of opening a European base to meet growing demand from European militaries.

The article highlights the advantages of using private companies like Draken International to provide training services, including cost savings and the ability to simulate a wider range of threats than military aggressor units can.

The other articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered an A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter that it has upgraded under a modernisation programme for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the growing market for commercial air support contracts. Several companies are competing for these lucrative contracts, including Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). These companies offer various services such as adversary air, joint terminal air control (JTAC) training, electronic warfare (EW) training, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.

The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) contract and the UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contract are two of the most lucrative contracts up for grabs. The ADAIR contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion over 10 years, with an operating cost of around $15,000 per flying hour.

The competing companies have a range of aircraft in their fleets, including F-16s, F-5Es, Alphajets, and Mirage F1s. Some companies are also partnering with other organizations to bid for the contracts. The article suggests that affordability will be a key issue in the competition, but there will also be a demand for more sophisticated aircraft.

The contracts require a significant number of flying hours, which may necessitate partnerships between bidders to meet the requirements. The article concludes that it is an "interesting time" ahead for the commercial air support market.
The article features an interview with Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International, a commercial air services company that provides tactical fighter jets for training and threat replication purposes to the US military.

Here are the key points from the interview:

* Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market, with over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s.
* The company's aircraft have undergone significant upgrades, including the installation of APG-66 radars and RWRs, making them highly capable and realistic adversaries for military training.
* Draken's services include "Red Air" adversary training, JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) training, and research and development support.
* The company has a strong infrastructure and logistics in place to support its operations, including a commitment to safety and professionalism.
* Draken's leadership team, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings a combination of tactical aviation experience and business savvy to the company.
* The company plans to sustain itself through its long-term investment in its fleet and infrastructure, unlike other firms that have failed in the past.
* Draken sees potential for international expansion, particularly among NATO nations, as contract air services continue to grow globally.

Overall, the article highlights Draken International's unique position in the commercial air services market, its commitment to providing high-quality training and support services to the US military, and its plans for future growth and expansion.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has ruled in favor of the defendant and intervenor, denying the plaintiff's (Draken) motions for judgment on the administrative record and injunctive relief.

The court found that Draken's claims of unfair treatment and prejudice were not ripe for judicial review because the agency had not yet selected an awardee and the outcome of the evaluation process was still uncertain. The court cited previous cases, including Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was deemed not fit for judicial review due to uncertainty over the transfer of property.

The court also refused to review the agency's denial of Draken's protest, stating that it lacked jurisdiction to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The court noted that its role is to review the underlying procurement decision or procurement-related actions, not the agency's protest decision itself.

In conclusion, the court denied Draken's motions and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the administrative record.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces? Jared Isaacman: Contract air services are continuing to grow on a global scale. The same savings the U.S. government is starting to enjoy will be recognized globally. Our immediate priority is to tackle the domestic workload, but we do anticipate future international expansion across NATO nations.

OPINION AND ORDER

WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.

On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article is about Draken International, a private company that operates as an air force, providing training services to the US military. The company was founded in 2011 and has grown rapidly since then. It operates a fleet of aircraft, including A-4 Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and MB-339s, which are used to simulate threats for military pilots.

The company's business model is based on providing cost-effective training services to the military. By using older, less expensive aircraft, Draken International can offer its services at a significantly lower cost than the military would incur if it were to use its own front-line fighter jets. The company estimates that it can save the military around $40,000 per flight hour compared to using an F-16.

Draken International's pilots are all ex-military personnel who have been trained on the company's aircraft. The company is currently looking to expand its operations to Europe and is in talks with several countries about establishing a base there.

The article also mentions that Draken International does not handle high-end missions, such as those undertaken by US Aggressor units, which use advanced fighter jets like the F-15 and F-18 to simulate threats. Instead, Draken International focuses on simulating threats from older, third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft.

The other three articles are unrelated news briefs:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter that it has upgraded under a modernization program for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group, a struggling airline, has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to recover financially.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the growing market for commercial air support contracts. The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are highlighted as lucrative opportunities, but there are several companies vying for these contracts.

Companies mentioned include:

* Draken International: A provider of adversary air and other aviation support services.
* Top Aces (formerly Discovery Air Defence): Provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) program. They have a fleet of Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk, IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets, and F-16s.
* Tactical Air Support: Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, with a fleet of upgraded F-5E and -F aircraft, as well as the ability to operate customer-owned aircraft like Su-27 Flanker and F-16C.
* Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC): Based in Newport News, Virginia, providing services to the US Navy. They have a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros, and recently acquired Mirage F1s.
* Textron: Teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, with a portfolio including the Textron AirLand Scorpion.

The companies are staffed by experienced aviators and are set up to support deployed operations. The CAF contract requires 12 operating bases across the US, and the ADAIR draft RFP specifies three categories of aircraft performance, ranging from subsonic to supersonic.

The estimated contract value for the CAF US is $6 billion over 10 years, or around $15,000 per flying hour. Affordability will be a key issue, but there will likely be a role for more sophisticated and capable aircraft. The requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting partnerships and acquisitions may be necessary to meet demand.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US military. The company owns over 50 tactical fighter jets, making it the largest privately owned fleet in the world. Draken's aircraft are equipped with advanced capabilities, including radar and avionics, which sets them apart from other CAS providers.

The company's services include "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, fleet defense training, and chase services. Its aircraft can also provide air-to-air refueling, which is a unique capability in the industry.

Draken's pilots and maintainers are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force personnel with extensive experience and expertise. The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and its reputation for providing high-quality services.

The article also mentions that Draken plans to operate from facilities other than its Lakeland headquarters, including a location at BAE Systems' facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport.

The company's leadership, including CEO Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and passion for aviation to the table. Isaacman's approach has motivated the company's employees to perform at their best, and Draken has executed a strategy of building a strong infrastructure and logistics to support its operations.

Finally, the article notes that Draken sees potential in providing its services outside of the US to foreign air forces, particularly across NATO nations.
The United States Court of Federal Claims has denied Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and injunctive relief, and granted the defendant's and intervenor's motions for judgment on the Administrative Record.

Draken had alleged that it was treated unfairly in a procurement process, but the court ruled that the issue is not ripe for judicial review because the agency has not yet selected an awardee. The court cited previous cases, including Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium, where a proposed site selection was not ripe for review because negotiations had not been concluded and Congressional funding was uncertain.

The court also refused to review the agency's denial of Draken's agency-level protest, citing lack of jurisdiction to directly review protest decisions of the agency or the GAO. The court noted that while it may assess whether a GAO decision was rational in order to determine whether a procurement action was reasonable, it does not have jurisdiction to review an agency protest decision.

The court concluded that withholding consideration of Draken's alleged unequal treatment would not cause hardship to Draken, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.

 Any air arm able to field 30 operational MiG-21s, 11 Douglas A-4K Skyhawks and which ordered up to 28 light combat jets would be placed well up the rankings in Flight International’s annual World Air Forces directory. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the aircraft listed above belong to a commercial company. Welcome to Draken International, the world’s largest private air force. Lakeland, Florida-based Draken formed in 2011, and has grown rapidly since then. Currently the company undertakes a range of training activities for the US military, but is also actively looking at opening a European base.  Draken International “Our business model was to be the first commercial air service provider to utilise fourth-generation tactical fighter aircraft,” says chief executive Jared Isaacman. “We felt that was a big differentiator between us and other companies in what is a very small industry.” The company initially achieved that fourth-generation label in the shape of the Skyhawks, which Draken bought from the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2012 after that air arm decided to retire its fast jet component in 2001. “They’re unlike any other Skyhawks in the world,” explains Isaacman. “They had a $300 million upgrade in the 1990s, where they basically took the guts out of the [Lockheed Martin] F-16 and put them into the Skyhawks.” This included a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, a glass cockpit and a MIL-STD-1553B databus. The aircraft were in storage in New Zealand for almost a decade, but had been very well preserved, Isaacman adds. As well as the Skyhawks and MiG-21s, which were purchased from Poland, the fleet includes nine Alenia Aermacchi MB-339s – also courtesy of New Zealand – plus five Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros bought from various US private owners. In their off-duty moments Isaacman and some of his colleagues fly these as the Black Diamonds aerobatic formation team. Competitors, he argues, tend to operate older equipment such as Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs, Hawker Hunters or Learjets for roles such as target-towing or electronic attack profiles. Draken’s aim of differentiating itself was further highlighted at July’s Farnborough International air show, Isaacman says, when the firm placed an order for up to 28 Aero Vodochody L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft (ALCA).  Draken International The single-seat ALCAs – derived from Aero’s 1970s-vintage L-39 Albatros – have been surplus to requirements since 72 were built were built in the early years of this century, and have been stored awaiting a purchaser. The aircraft, Isaacman says, exactly fit a niche in the company’s fleet. Having been built from 2001-2003, “that means [the type is] very supportable and sustainable”. “They have no flight time on them and are packed with fourth-generation radar capabilities, as part of a suite designed by Selex,” he adds. The aircraft have a Grifo-L multimode pulse Doppler radar and a glass cockpit, plus HOTAS controls. “The big bonus for us is they’re hyper-efficient. They have a modern [Honeywell] F124 engine and use almost no gas,” he says. Draken is spending additional money on the ALCAs to upgrade their performance. The improvements will include aerodynamic refinements to increase top speed, although Isaacman declined to provide details, citing proprietary information. Also, manoeuvring flaps already used on the two-seat version of the aircraft – but which have not previously been fitted to the single-seaters – will be added. These will be designed by Aero. Draken will take “up to 28” examples. This formula was originally agreed with the Czech airframer, but the Iraqi government then weighed in with what Isaacman describes as “a pretty strong bid” for 12-15 of the aircraft held in storage. If that order comes to fruition, Draken is still guaranteed a minimum of 14 aircraft. At present, however, the Iraqi bid seemed not to be progressing, he says. In cost terms, the deal is small change for an air force, but “a very large and expensive purchase for us”. Draken plans to have the first examples operational by late 2014 or early 2015. Missions flown for the US armed forces run the gamut of training roles – from simple tasks such as gunnery banner towing to flying cruise missile flight profiles against US Navy vessels. The main driver behind the use of Draken’s aircraft in these roles is, of course, cost. “There are three key things that drive cost savings for our customers,” Isaacman says. “There’s a huge gap between what it costs to fly one of our aircraft and what it costs to fly a [front-line] military jet. Our aircraft cost around $7,000 an hour. “That’s $40,000 per flight hour in cost savings compared to an F-16. When you move up to something like a [Lockheed Martin] F-35 or a [Eurofighter] Typhoon, it’s something like $80,000. “Secondly, every fighter aircraft has a life expectancy of something like 8,000 flight hours. Every fighter aircraft is destined for the boneyard. Every hour we can fly in place of a front-line fighter aircraft is an hour you don’t have to expend on that fighter’s airframe.” Finally, there is the danger of “negative training”. With many Western fighter pilots only getting around 150 hours of flight time per year, it makes no sense to use up some of that valuable time flying missions such as cruise missile profiles that will never be of use to them in conflict. While all Draken’s work is currently undertaken for the US military, it is actively looking at opening a European base. “We’re in a number of conversations because of the growing demand,” Isaacman says. “The French navy, for example, uses L-39s and Hunters to provide threat simulation. The L-39 is a great trainer aircraft, but it has no equipment to create new-generation threats.” Finding a suitable European location “is obviously a big decision for us”, and will depend on several factors including security and costs. Draken does not handle the high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, however. “The Aggressors that fly [Boeing] F-15s, F-18s [and F-16s] can simulate just about every threat in the world,” he says. “However, there are a wide variety of threats from third-generation or early fourth-generation aircraft that it might be too costly to use Aggressor aircraft to simulate. “You would look to have the Aggressors focus on simulating MiG-29s and [Shenyang] J-11s. We can easily simulate MiG-21s and other third/fourth-generation types.” The company draws its pilots from ex-military ranks. “We have a lot of ex-USN and USMC pilots who used to fly A-4s and F-16. Pilots seem to adapt to the A-4 very easily,” Isaacman says. The MB-339s, meanwhile, “are just a joy to fly”, he adds. “An original group of us was trained to fly by an Italian 339 pilot. It’s well-designed and easy to adapt to.” As all the MB-339s are two-seaters, it is a relatively simple process to train new pilots on the type.  Draken International It was less easy finding pilots for the MiG-21s. “There’s no expertise in the USA on that aircraft whatsoever, but we’ve been on very good terms speaking with [MRO provider] Aerostar in Romania, who have been able to provide a lot of guidance,” he says. For fighter pilots retiring from military service after 15-20 years, being able to continue to fly fighter aircraft is “a dream scenario”, Isaacman adds. Despite the increasing sophistication of simulators, at some point pilots have to experience real aircraft coming after them. “Simulators are great – and the more that fidelity increases, the more valuable they will be. But as a pilot myself, seeing another aircraft coming at you creates a much higher tempo than just sitting at a computer,” Isaacman says. Source: Flight International

 The increasing cost of using front-line aircraft to support operational training is becoming progressively more untenable, in terms of cost, availability and wear-and-tear on operational aircraft fleets. MS&T’s Dim Jones delved into the world of contracted adversary air support during a visit to Draken International.  The high purchase and operating costs of modern 4th- and 5th-generation combat aircraft in a climate of budgetary restraint, coupled with shortages of pilots in many air forces, have forced a rethink in the way adversary air and other support functions are provided for the front line. The problem is potential real-life adversaries are other 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft, and they are generally only to be found in the inventories of the adversary air forces themselves. Using them to replicate the enemy is extremely expensive for three reasons:     This dilemma was illustrated some years ago when, in a bid to reduce overall costs, the USAF reduced the number of dedicated aggressor aircraft in the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, the intention being that the front-line squadrons should assimilate this additional task. This policy proved unsustainable, and prompted a reappraisal of how adversary air and other support functions could be provided.  One solution is the use of commercially owned and operated ex-military aircraft, suitably modified to replicate the desired threats while reducing the operating costs to a minimum. As a rough guide, it costs US$25,000 per hour to operate an F-16C/D, $35,000 for an F-15C/D/E and $85,000 for an F-22A. By contrast, commercial providers can operate older aircraft, even upgraded, for 20% of these costs or less; more sophisticated aircraft are available at commensurately higher prices.  It is self-evident that these types do not have the capabilities of the front-line aircraft; however, in the right hands, they can go a long way toward replicating the required threats, and an inventory of different aircraft types, with different levels of systems modification, can be tailored to meet specific training needs.  The ‘right hands’ are central to the solution; while the adversary aircraft may not actually have the performance or the systems of the aircraft being replicated, the knowledge and expertise of the pilot can go a long way toward redressing this imbalance. Sadly (or, in the case of commercial operators, happily) an era of constantly diminishing front lines means that there is currently no shortage of ex-military aviators on the market; and it can be argued that, while the air forces may mourn their loss, many would be leaving anyway. They may prefer staying in a fighter cockpit to a life in the airlines or elsewhere, and their expertise is being effectively retained for the good of the active military.  Finding suitable airframes can be more problematic. The late-Block F-16 is generally accepted as the gold-standard 4th-generation adversary fighter. However, these aircraft are generally in heavy demand by coalition partners and, although they may cost less to run in a lean commercial organisation than in the military, they are still expensive. Older block aircraft tend to have limited fatigue and engine life remaining and, indeed, may not be supportable by the OEM. Available ex-Soviet types (MiG-29, Su-27) tend to be of the earlier generations, would be expensive – if not impossible – to modify, and would require heavy reliance on foreign nations for support. As regards lighter types, such as the F-5, the best have already been purchased by other nations, two engines make them relatively expensive to run, they have limited range and endurance, and physical constraints make them difficult to upgrade with modern radars.  Notwithstanding these significant issues, it is apparent that, if the right solutions can be produced at the right price, there is a ready market for this type of commercial enterprise. The USAF’s upcoming Adversary Air (ADAIR) programme, estimated at $6 billion over 10 years to cover all of Combat Air Forces (CAF), would contract out nearly 37,000 flight hours to provide adversary air services, filling the gaps at the USAF’s 57th Wing weapons school and Red Flag training events, as well as operational test and evaluation missions at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The USAF released a draft solicitation in July 2017, with an expected contract award in 2019; meanwhile, the US Navy is expected to release a draft solicitation in the middle of this year. On a very much smaller scale, the UK’s ASDOT programme, which inter alia comprises Red Air, EW training, JTAC and maritime operations support, and air traffic control training, could be worth an estimated £1.25bn ($1.5bn) over 15 years. With potential rewards of this order, several companies appear to be in a position to ‘throw their hats into the ring’.   One likely adversary air player is Draken International. I had the opportunity to visit them at their headquarters on the perimeter of the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in central Florida. My host for the visit, Maj Gen (Ret) Jake Polumbo was, until 2015, Commander US 9th Air Force and, prior to that, held many prestigious appointments, not least as Commander of the 52nd Operations Group (F-16), the 80th Flying Training Wing (T-38) and the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (U-2). He is also a Command Pilot with more than 4000 hours, most of them in all blocks of F-16, and a USAF Fighter Weapons School graduate and instructor. It was clear that I was going to get more than an industry-perspective view of the subject.  The company is only about five years old, and was founded by Jared Isaacman, its president, CEO and sole investor. Although a banker by trade, with no active military experience, he flies all the company’s aircraft, military and corporate; he also formed, and flies right wing in, the Black Diamonds formation team, which flies Aerovodochody L-39s. Supporting Isaacman is a Board of Advisors comprising retired senior officers of the USAF, USN and US Marine Corps with many stars between them, and executive and management teams with an impressive number of flight hours and experience in every theatre of operations and almost every current and recently retired US fighter aircraft, plus a good few other types, both US and foreign. Draken International’s maintenance hub is also at Lakeland, and they currently have one other main operating base at Nellis AFB. There is also a facility at Mojave in California, where the company conducts flight testing and special projects. From these locations, tailored detachments of aircrew and groundcrew deploy to wherever they are needed, not exclusively in the US; for example, a Draken detachment recently deployed in support of a Fighter Weapons School course at Leeuwarden Air Base for the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF), a consortium of F-16 users comprising The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Denmark.   In June, Draken won a $280 million contract to provide more than 5,600 annual flight hours of adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada through December 2023. Daily flight schedules of 18-24 commercial ADAIR sorties will support combat readiness training for the USAF Weapons School, operational test missions, Red Flag exercises, Formal Training Unit syllabus rides from Luke AFB and out of Hill AFB, Utah.    The aircraft fleet is over 100, with more than 35 in current use and 20+ in active use, responding to demand. Types include L159E, A-4, Mirage F1, Aermacchi MB-339-CB, and Mig-21BIS. The 21 L159s are ex-Aerovodochody, and the type is in current operational use with the Iraqi Air Force. The A-4s are a mix of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4Ks and ex-Israeli Air Force A-4Ns, plus some TA-4Js. The A-4Ks, although retaining the smaller engine, have received a major avionics and radar upgrade, and can carry Maverick, AIM-9, and PaveWay II GBU-16. The nine MB-339s are also ex-RNZAF, and the MiG-21s ex-Polish Air Force. There is, as yet, no call for the MiG-21s, so they are mothballed, but could reach initial operating capability within 12 months of a requirement.  A major recent development is the upgrading of the company’s supersonic capability, with the acquisition of Mirage F1Ms and Atlas Cheetah C/Ds. The 22 Mirage F1s are recently ex-Spanish Air Force, upgraded in the mid-90s, and are expected to achieve IOC in Quarter 2-2018. They are capable of Mach 2.2, with a service ceiling of 65,000 feet and 2.5 hours endurance. The latest modernisation will include Link 16, Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems (HMCS), High off-Boresight (HOBS) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM), Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST), advanced targeting pods and accurate threat missile dynamic launch zones (DLZ). Fourteen aircraft will be equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar, and the remaining six aircraft will have Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar for Engagement and Surveillance (ARES).  Draken’s latest acquisition is nine ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetah Cs, and three 2-seat Cheetah Ds. The Cheetah is a result of a complete rebuild and upgrade of Mirage IIIs, based on the Israeli Kfir. These aircraft were regenerated at the facility of the OEM, now Denel Aviation of South Africa, by a team including many ex-SAAF personnel. The new supersonic aircraft are starting to arrive at Lakeland Linder airport and are scheduled to start flying acceptance sorties this summer. Once certified for flight by the FAA, they will probably move west to Nevada.   The hallmark of successful commercial air support is the provision of a professional and credible threat capability at an affordable price. The platforms are one element of this; people are the other.  Dealing with maintenance first, Lt Col (Ret) Jeff Spann is Draken’s Director of Maintenance and Logistics. Five years after retiring from a varied and illustrious USAF career, including maintenance on F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B and B-52H, and culminating in a post as Deputy Maintenance Group Commander for Ellsworth AFB’s 28 B-1Bs and its 1500 maintainers, he now presides over a very much leaner team (numbering just over 140 at Lakeland and Nellis), but an equally demanding role. Draken’s aircraft are on the civil register and have FAA airworthiness certification. They also have military certification from both the USAF and US Navy. Spann’s troops, mostly experienced ex-military and over-qualified for the jobs they are doing, deal with a significantly wider inventory of aircraft than they would normally encounter in a military environment.  Capt (USN Ret) Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is Chief Pilot and Director of Deployed Operations. The USN’s high time F-14 pilot with 4890 hrs, he leads a team whose experience and qualifications are, frankly, eye-watering. They are ex-USMC, USN and USAF pilots, with F-15/-16/-18/-22 and -35 experience, graduates of the USAF Fighter Weapons School and USN Top Gun, and Operational Test & Evaluation.  These qualities also extend to the Draken Management Team: the Director of Business Development, Lt Col (USMC Ret) Jeff “Magwa” Scott has nearly 2000 hours of AV-8B time, was the world’s first operationally qualified F-35 pilot and stood up, as Commander, the first operational F-35 squadron. If the performance of upgraded and refurbished 3rd- and 4th-generation aircraft can be enhanced, by means of the qualities of the pilots flying them, to provide an adversary capability that belies their vintage (the aircraft, not the pilots), this is the sort of team to do it.
     Draken currently has a further 13 operating locations outside the US. There is a facility at Nimes in France, and additional locations in the UK, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Greenland and Canada. This structure provides the ability to mount frequent and cost-effective small detachments to meet customer needs, which, if not managed effectively, could have a negative impact on the stability, family and quality of life of those involved – among the factors which may have influenced their individual decisions to leave regular military service. However, and even though they retain the ability to vote with their feet, all concerned appear to be happy with the arrangements. The company has also developed close links with Florida Polytechnic University, who offer support in two specific areas of high-tech applied research – improving Draken’s global supply-chain logistics and modernising their fleet.  The ability to forecast customer requirements and provide an aircraft inventory capable of meeting them is key to success; the seemingly obvious choices are not always the best or most cost-effective ones – and cost-effectiveness is a major reason why the USAF and others arrived at this point. A $1billion investment can buy you 14 late-generation F-16 or 10 F-35, not including pilots, maintenance, facilities and fuel; alternatively, it can buy you 150,000 turnkey flight hours in aircraft such as the A-4 over a 10-year period, all-inclusive.  Pre-loved 4th-gen aircraft are a superficially attractive option, but are hard to find, would remain costly to operate and would not necessarily be any more operationally capable than upgraded aircraft from earlier generations. As CEO Jared Isaacman observes: “We can provide fourth-generation adversaries (electronic attack pods, radars, etc) for a fifth of the operating cost of an F-16 or F-15. That is the value of our service. We deliver enhanced training for a much, much lower cost. If we were to purchase F-16s, we would not be able to offer any cost savings at all.”  Draken is a relatively new but forward-looking organisation at the forefront of a rapidly expanding facet of the aviation industry, with a dynamic executive team, steered by a multi-starred and -talented advisory board, and boasting a management and staff both exceptionally experienced and well-qualified. There will be stiff competition from other providers for the lucrative commercial air support contracts that lie around the corner, but I have little doubt that Draken will be in the mix.    The US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts are, of course, not the only prizes on offer, although they might be the most lucrative; nor are Draken International the only providers in the field.   There are several companies offering adversary air and other aviation support services, and all of them are expected to bid for one or both the ASDOT and ADAIR contracts. In addition to pure Red Air, other services that might be required by a customer air force are Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) Training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training.  Montreal-based Top Aces (formerly known as Discovery Air Defence, recently reverted to its original title) provides support to the Canadian Armed Forces through the Contracted Airborne Training Services (CATS) programme. Its fleet includes Alphajet, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawk – acquired through the 2013 purchase of Advanced Training Systems International (ATSI) – and IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets. The company has also acquired F-16s in order to bid for the USAF CAF ADAIR contract, and is teamed with Leonardo and Inzpire as “Red Aces” for ASDOT.  Meanwhile, Tactical Air Support, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has a fleet principally comprising upgraded F-5E and -F, although interestingly they can also operate aircraft owned by their customers, such as Su-27 Flanker and F-16C. The avionic upgrade to the F-5s includes Duotech radar and radar warning receiver (RWR).  The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), based at Newport News, Virginia and currently providing services to the US Navy, has a fleet of ex-Israeli AF F-21 Kfir, ex-Swiss Air Force Mk 58 Hawker Hunters, and Czech Aerovodochody L-39 Albatros. In addition, ATAC, now part of Textron, has recently acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1s, of which they plan to retrofit the majority with new avionics and radar. Textron is teamed with Thales and QinetiQ for ASDOT, and includes within its portfolio the Textron AirLand Scorpion, which could provide other support services such as JTAC and EW training.             These companies are staffed by multi-qualified and extremely experienced aviators, some of whom are also in current military flying practice elsewhere (such as in the US Air National Guard). Their organisations are set up to support deployed operations; the CAF contract, for example, has specified 12 operating bases, from Langley in the east to Hickam (Hawaii) in the west. As regards specific platform requirements, the CAF ADAIR draft RFP, released in April, embraces three categories of aircraft and equipment performance, ranging from subsonic, with low-turn performance and 3rd-generation avionics, to supersonic, agile and Generation 4+ capability. Meeting the right-hand end of this spectrum at an affordable price could be quite challenging but, for instance, and although not itself a declared bidder, Saab is actively marketing a version of the Gripen C to meet high-end adversary air requirements, and Leonardo is doing the same with the M-346.  Although figures vary, and direct mathematical calculation may not take into account extraneous costs, the estimated contract values for the CAF US ($6 billion over 10 years at 37,000 hrs/year) works out at something over $15,000 per flying hour. The ASDOT contract is not yet quantified to that degree, and also calls for the inclusion of services other than adversary air. $15K is significantly less than the quoted operating cost of an F-16C, but it is also significantly more than the likely operating costs of some of the older-generation, and less capable, aircraft in the competing contractors’ existing fleets. Affordability will be a key issue, but the overall requirement will be spread across the full spectrum of aircraft capability categories, suggesting that there will be a role (and a demand) for aircraft more sophisticated than those currently available, and a budget which allows some headroom for acquiring, modifying and operating them. 37,000 is also a lot of flying hours and will probably require more aircraft than any bidder currently has active, so there may also be scope for partnerships, particularly since the contract is set to begin in 2019, and it takes a finite time to locate, acquire, modify as necessary, and obtain clearance for, new aircraft, to say nothing of the aircrew and maintainers required to support them. Interesting times ahead. – Dim Jones  Originally published in MS&T Issue 3, 2018.    Bringing together leaders in airline training to share knowledge, talent, and experience.

 Draken International’s  large and diverse fleet of aircraft for contract air services allows them to fill a variety of roles for customers. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The market for commercial air services (CAS), alternately known as outsourced flight support,  contract adversary support, or commercial Red Air, seems to be gaining altitude. Cutbacks in defense budgets dating back to the mid-1990s have left the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps with little organic adversary support. Several private firms fielding fleets of third-generation fighters and trainers, as well as support aircraft, have attempted to fill the gap, offering a range of commercial air services. Defense Media Network has profiled two – ATAC USA and Omega International. Now, we take a look at one of the newest and largest entrants into this unique business – Draken International. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla. at Lakeland Linder Airport, Draken International was launched quietly at the end of 2011, but has made considerable noise in 2013. In April, Florida Governor Rick Scott held a press conference to announce that Draken would create 55 jobs and invest $67 million in its Lakeland facilities over the next three years. Led by Jared Isaacman, founder of the successful payments-processing firm Harbortouch, Draken is now physically the largest player in the CAS business, with a fleet of more than 50 tactical aircraft. Comprised of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (11), ex-RNZAF MB-339CB trainers (9), Aero L-39s (5), ex-Polish MiG-21bis/UM (25), and Beech Baron and Cessna Citation 650 support aircraft, the group also represents the world’s largest privately-held fleet of tactical aircraft. The firm aims to be the leader in CAS, and along with its large fleet, counts a roster of experienced pilots among its executives and management, and recently retired general/flag officers on its board of advisors. The L-39s that formed the core of its fleet derive from the six-ship L-39-equipped Black Diamond Jet Team that Isaacman formed as the “Heavy Metal Jet Team” in 2011. To date, the company has won one small contract with the Navy, which it has been flying in support of since July 2012, according to Sean Gustafson, Draken’s VP of Client Relations. We spoke with Draken CEO Jared Isaacman and Sean Gustafson for details on the new firm. The L-39s of Draken International form the core of its fleet, and are derived from the Black Diamond Jet Team. Black Diamond Jet Team photo Jan Tegler: How did the idea for Draken International arise? Apparently, the Black Diamond Jet Team members were instrumental in its formation. Was this an inspiration Mr. Isaacman had, an opportunity recognized by the team members, or did it evolve more broadly? Jared Isaacman: Draken International did evolve from the Black Diamond Jet Team. The idea was a collaboration throughout the team and ultimately came to fruition after our first major aircraft acquisition. While we all enjoyed our time flying with Black Diamond, the organization is now extremely focused on our rapidly growing enterprise at Draken.   Why launch Draken now? The demand for the work we perform, CAS, has never been stronger. The present fiscal environment calls for cost savings. So the opportunity is right for the business model we provide. That stated, we weren’t going to enter the industry unless we could differentiate ourselves from those that have tried to create this model previously. That is why we searched the world and purchased the best aircraft to exceed the requirements of our important Department of Defense customers.   What is it about the current defense landscape and the market for contract air support that Draken finds attractive? The present budget constraints are forcing the Department of Defense to find innovative ways to save money. Utilizing CAS such as Draken positions the government to save upwards of a billion dollars over the next decade. As an example, we can put five of our A-4K Skyhawks in the air for the price of a single F-16 on an hourly basis. In today’s environment, that type of savings can’t be ignored. In addition, delays with the F-35 program have put a premium value on the remaining flight hours on legacy fighters such as F-16, F-15 and F-18s. That puts Draken in a unique situation where we can save the government tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour and preserve the valuable life remaining on the legacy fighter force. In terms of physical size, Draken International is the largest player in the commercial air services (CAS) market. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   How will the company differentiate itself from other firms in this space? We feel there are a lot of things that differentiate Draken International. This includes our organizational infrastructure, financial resources, and maintenance practices, but without a question our aircraft are what truly sets us apart. We own over 50 tactical fighter jets – the largest privately owned fleet in the world. The quantity and more importantly the capabilities our jets have are unmatched. Our Douglas A-4K Skyhawks underwent a several hundred million dollar upgrade program in New Zealand to include the radar, avionics, data bus and other capabilities typically found in the F-16. This gives our customers a tactically relevant adversary with generation-four capabilities while at the same time saving substantial dollars.   What is the range of services the company will provide? Draken provides a wide range of services, from “Red Air” adversary support to research and development. Other missions include fleet defense training, JTAC [joint terminal attack controller] training, and chase services, as well as air to air refueling. Our A-4K Skyhawks have buddy stores which are able to pass fuel to any probe-equipped aircraft or refuel ourselves. This provides an incredible cost-savings to our customer versus using a tanker aircraft or a Navy asset. It also extends our own capabilities, providing the customer with more training instead of wasted time going back and forth to the base to refuel. We are the only CAS provider that operates buddy store refueling tanks. In all cases, our missions are about training and threat replication. Our role is not to replace U.S. military aggressors but to augment and compliment them in a pure training role. Draken International’s former New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawks (TA-4K shown background) are equipped with the APG-66 radar and other advanced equipment never seen on typical Skyhawks. One of the company’s Macchi MB-339s is in the foreground. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos   What is the makeup of Draken aircrew and maintainers? They are primarily ex-Navy and Air Force pilots and maintainers. Each one has been hired for their specific expertise. We have Fighter Weapons School and Top Gun Instructors, and our maintainers have attended the best schools in the world. For aircrew specifically, we tend to look towards part-time U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force Reserve and Guard pilots that are able to make Draken their full time job and continue their military service part-time. This ensures we have the most current and experienced pilots possible.   How is the company finding talent? The company has continued to grow through word of mouth and recommendations. The governor of Florida held a press conference in our hangar in April and that gave us a flood of resumes of highly talented individuals. We are fortunate to be able to pick the best of the best to work with us.   How significant is the inclusion of APG-66 radars and RWRs on the firm’s A-4Ks? The APG-66 Radar and RWR are certainly a differentiator in today’s market. The ability to target aircraft or “spike” them provides a realistic threat. Our ability to be a RWR aware threat and react is unmatched. America’s fourth and especially fifth-gen fighters need more than just a piece of metal in the sky to target. Draken provides a great deal more.   The A-4Ks were equipped with the APG-66 while still in RNZAF service, correct? Yes, the A-4Ks were equipped with APG-66 while in RNZAF service and maintained at a high FMC (mission-capable) rate. We have all the equipment needed to support these radars as well as the spares. It is an outstanding radar and is excellent in the aggressor role. In fact, the U.S. Navy F-16 aggressors operate very similar radar, as well as numerous other militaries around the world. We’re fortunate to benefit from the several hundred million dollar upgrade program that New Zealand felt these aircraft deserved.   What’s the reasoning behind the mix of aircraft Draken is fielding currently (presumably the availability of ex-RNZAF aircraft had a lot to do with it) and how are pilots trained on the different aircraft types (particularly the MiG-21s)? While we operate three different aircraft types, it’s important to see the role they fill for the customer. Having aircraft that fit specific mission sets helps ensure we are providing the best service. One of Draken International’s A-4Ks in the hangar. The company has a commitment to a strong infrastructure and logistics as much as to acquiring the best aircraft and personnel. Draken International photo by Jose Ramos The A-4K Skyhawk is a true multi-role platform that can fulfill A/G, A/A and R&D mission sets. The Mig-21 is our optimal supersonic platform, equipped with a NATO “JAY BIRD” radar. The Aermacchi MB-339 is clearly the best JTAC training platform in the A/G role available in the CAS industry. Our pilots are full time pilots trained on one airframe, becoming experts on the platform and its related missions. This increases safety, professionalism and ensures the best service for our customer.   Does the company plan to operate from facilities other than the Lakeland headquarters?
 Sean Gustafson: We currently have two A-4Ks at BAE System’s facility at Mojave Air and Spaceport. Draken’s executive team and its board have considerable tactical aviation experience, but Mr. Isaacman does not. What does his leadership bring to the company? Sean Gustafson: Mr. Isaacman brings incredible business savvy and an unmatched passion for aviation to the company. His successes over the past decade as CEO of Harbortouch give him the experience needed to take Draken to the highest level in the industry. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers. He has thousands of hours of flying private and tactical aircraft and continues to excel in every airframe. His confident and approachable attitude motivates every person in Draken to perform at his or her very best. The Draken “culture” stems from Mr. Isaacman and it is certainly a winning attitude.   Other firms in this space, working primarily with the Navy via commercial air services contracts and the Air Force through MIPR (military interdepartmental purchase request) money have come and gone. How will Draken sustain itself? Jared Isaacman: We have the best-equipped fleet and the ability to sustain these aircraft for many years. We made a commitment when we went out and purchased these aircraft. Others have simply leased a few jets with little support behind them and were destined for failure from the beginning. Draken has executed a strategy we call “Field of Dreams –if you build it they will come.” As such, we purchased the best jets and built an unbelievable infrastructure to support them. We have the expertise to pilot and maintain these aircraft and we have an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. We believe we have put all the pieces together to be a true asset to the U.S. government and taxpayers.   Does Draken see potential in providing its services outside CONUS to foreign air forces?

OPINION AND ORDER  
_________________________________________________________  
 
WILLIAMS , Judge.  
 
This pre -award bid protest comes before the Court on the parties’ cross -motions for 
judgment on the Administrative Record (“AR”).  Plaintiff, Draken International, Inc. (“Draken”), 
challenges the procurement process implemented by the Department of the Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) under solicitation number N00019 -12-R-1001.  Plaintiff argues 
that NAVAIR violated the Competition in Contra cting Act (“CICA”) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”)2 because its delay in conducting the procurement coupled with 
the solicitation’s requirement that the awardee provide both subsonic (“Type III”) and supersonic 
(“Type IV”) aircraft unduly re stricts competition.  Plaintiff asserts that this solicitation process 
will result in a de facto sole -source award to Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., LLC (“ATAC”), 
the incumbent. Because ATAC is currently being paid by the Government to maintain its fleet ,  
Plaintiff submits that ATAC can avoid the prohibitive cost foisted upon other offerors of meeting 
operational readiness requirements during a prolonged procurement process.  Plaintiff also 
protests the duration of a sole -source bridge contract awarded t o ATAC, which could potentially 
last until July 2015 , given the option periods.  Finally, Plaintiff contends that it was t reated 
unequally compared to [***]  other offerors that were allowed to provide new airworthiness data 
after the deadline for submissio n of initial offers, while it was not given this opportunity.   
 
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that NAVAIR violated CICA and the FAR by 
unduly restricting competition in its conduct of this procurement.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to 
order NAVA IR to limit the term of ATAC’s sole -source bridge contract to coincide with a final 
award date and to amend the solicitation to separately procure subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
services. Alternatively, Plaintiff asks the Court to limit an award under th e current solicitation to 
the base year and issue a new solicitation for subsequent years or allow all offerors the 
opportunity to offer new aircraft in the event their originally proposed aircraft are no longer 
available.    
 
Defendant argues that Draken’ s challenge to the solicitation’s terms combining 
procurement of supersonic and subsonic aircraft is untimely, that the delay in the procurement 
process resulted from multiple protests, and that the solicitation’s terms are reasonable and 
necessary to meet  NAVAIR’s requirements.  Defendant asserts that Draken was not treated any 
                                                           
2  Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated “FAR Part 6” and FAR 15.305.  See Pl. Mot. for 
Judgment on the AR at i, 24.  Plaintiff does not specify a specific provision within FAR Part 6, 
but FAR Part 6 generally “prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open 
competition in the acquisition process.” 48 C.F.R. § 6.000 (2012).  Plaintiff does not further 
explain how it believes the Government violated FAR 15.305, which discusses factors for 
proposal evaluation and requires that “an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then 
assess their relative qualities solel y on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation.”  
48 C.F.R. § 15.305.    
3 
 differently than other offerors, as Draken was also given a chance to amend its proposal.  ATAC 
argues that Draken does not have standing to bring the instant protest because it no longer 
qualifies for award, that no improper bundling of requirements has occurred, and that Draken’s 
allegations of unfair treatment are not ripe.  
   
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, its protest is 
timely, the Agen cy’s delayed procurement process did not violate CICA, and Draken ’s challenge 
to unequal treatment is unripe.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
The Contracted Air Services Program and Issuance of Solicitation N00019 -12-R-1001  
 
 The United States Department of the Navy’s  Contracted Air Services (“CAS”) program 
“provides Contractor owned and operated aircraft, personnel, equipment and support for Fleet 
training and exercises to a variety of customers to include: United States Navy (USN), Foreign 
Military Sales, and other D epartment of Defense (DoD) agencies and DoD contractors.”  AR 
223. Contractors working under the CAS program provide aircraft and related services for 
“airborne threat simulation” and training exercises for the benefit of “shipboard and aircraft 
squadron w eapon systems operators and aircrew . . . .”   Id.  In May 2009, ATAC was awarded a 
firm fixed price/indefinite -delivery indefinite -quantity contract for the provision of both subsonic 
Type III and supersonic Type IV aircraft, which fly at higher speeds and  are more expensive and 
difficult to obtain, to support the CAS program.  Id. at 35 -36, 225, 3407.  This contract ended on 
July 28, 2014, and NAVAIR has been obtaining  these services via ATAC’s sole -source bridge 
contract since then.  Id. At 3407.  
 
 On Ju ne 21, 2013, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition) wrote a “Determination and Findings For Authority to Award a 
Single Source Task Order Contract” for the solicitation at issue.   Id. at 4469. This docume nt was 
created because the Department of Defense may not award task and delivery order contracts 
exceeding $103 million, inclusive of options, to a single source, “unless the head of the agency 
determines in writing that the task or delivery orders expecte d under the contract are so integrally 
related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work.” Id.  According to Assistant 
Secretary Stackley, a single -source indefinite -delivery/indefinite -quantity contract permitted “the 
greatest flexibility in both quantities and schedule to meet the needs of the Fleet in providing 
combat readiness training.”  Id.  Furthermore, making a single contractor  “the integrator across 
all locations” avoided the Government either having to take on this integrator rol e itself or 
expend additional resources that were not budgeted.  Id. at 4470.  
 
 Assistant Secretary Stackley articulated reasons why Type III and Type IV aircraft were 
included in the same solicitation, stating:  
 
                                                           
3  These findings of fact are derived from the AR.  Additional findings of fact are in the 
Discussion.   
4 
 The simultaneous presentation requirement for high subsonic and supersonic 
aircraft was developed based on the current contract practice of authorizing the 
contractor to fulfill high subsonic missions with supersonic aircraft, which are 
billed at the lower high subsonic contract rate.  This augmen tation of high 
subsonic aircraft allows the Government to minimize the required quantity of high 
subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge requirements.  
 
With a multiple award contract, the ability to augment high subsonic aircraft for 
surge requirements is lost, and the Government would be required to increase the 
required number of high subsonic aircraft to maintain the same level of contractor 
coverage. The ability to augment high subsonic aircraft saves the [United States 
Navy] a nd [the Department of Defense] money because it results in a higher 
utilization of supersonic aircraft and avoids the payment of fixed aircraft costs for 
additional high subsonic aircraft.   Due to fiscal constraints, which are expected to 
become more sever e, the [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defense] 
do not have the funds to cover the cost of additional high subsonic aircraft; 
therefore, award of a multiple award contract would result in a degraded level of 
training because fewer aircraft woul d be available for scheduling.  
 
Additionally, this scenario would lead to inefficiencies and increase contractor 
costs to the point of making the desired level of training unaffordable. A single 
source provider gains efficiencies due to commonality of reso urces provided for 
each aircraft platform at each site. Aircraft platforms at each site require 
mechanics, parts, and tooling, as well as Quality Assurance, training, certification 
and technical publication support functions. These can all be achieved acro ss both 
the high subsonic and supersonic aircraft using shared manpower, common 
spaces, and a large amount of common parts and tooling.  
 
Two contractors performing at a single location, each providing the training 
services on separate types of aircraft, wo uld require additional space, parts, 
tooling and personnel resources to maintain the same level of service as a single 
source provider. This would directly increase the contract costs of the training.  
The [United States Navy] and [the Department of Defens e] do not have the funds 
to cover increased training costs; therefore less training flight time would be 
ordered – resulting in a degraded state of operational readiness.  
 
For the reasons stated above, the task orders expected to be issued under this 
contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform 
this effort, and awarding task orders to different contractors based upon the type 
of aircraft would not be feasible.  
 
Id. at 4470 -71. Assistant Secretary Stackely concluded, “[i]f a single source task order contract 
award is not approved, the Government would lose the advantage of efficiencies and economies 
of a single contractor operating all aircraft across all geographic areas, would risk aircraft 
availability for surge req uirements, and would incur duplication of costs associated with 
providing and maintaining multiple fleets of aircraft.”  Id. at 4473.    
5 
  
On July 25, 2013, NAVAIR issued the solicita tion.  The performance period was to be up 
to five years, comprised of a base year and four one -year options. Id. at 258, 514. This 
solicitation sought at least 14 Type III aircraft and five Type IV aircraft and related services.  Id. 
at 721, 723. The orig inal due date for offers was Septem ber 24, 2013, and the contract was to 
commence upon award with a 60 -day “phase -in period,” during which the contractor was 
required to become operationally ready.  Id. at 495, 514.  Operational readiness included 
securing  an East Coast permanent basing site and “positioning required aircraft and support 
infrastructure to other permanent basing sites.”  Id. at 998.  
 
Section L, Volume 2.1,  set forth the technical pre -requisites, requiring a copy of the FAA 
Airworthiness Cer tificate for each aircraft, identifying the aircraft by tail number, and identifying 
each aircraft as “primary” or “backup.”  Id. at 569. Volume 2.3 required offerors to provide 
detailed aircraft airworthiness data.  This data was to include tracking and p lanning for 
replacement of parts, an inspection plan, modifications to each aircraft after it was retired from 
military use, “an accounting for the timeframe from manufacture to proposal submittal date” and 
a description of each aircraft’s maintenance hist ory.  Id. at 572 -73.  
 
The “anticipated award date” was stated to be March 1, 2014, and the solicitation 
indicated that “[t]his information is provided for use as a basis for schedules and burden (labor, 
overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  Id. at 586.  Additionally, the performance 
periods were described as “estimates only.”  Id. at 515.  The award would be made on a “best 
value” basis in consideration of the technical, past performance, and cost factors, in that order of 
importance.   Id. at 58 9.  
 
Amendments to the Solicitation and Air USA, Inc.’s Protests  
 
 The solicitation was amended 10 times. The amendment relevant to the instant case is 
Amendment 6, issued on October 11, 2013, which created two phases to the technical evaluation.  
Id. at 848, 866 -67. In Phase I, the Government would create a single technical rating for each 
proposal based on the required technical elements, including the provision of airworthiness data. 
In Phase II, offerors were required to provide FAA Airworthiness C ertificates for each aircraft 
“no later than three (3) business days following the Government’s request for Final Proposal 
Revisions (FPRs), “anticipated to be on or about 3 July 2014.”  Id. at 1059. Amendment 5 
changed the due date for proposals to Novemb er 12, 2013 and the anticipated award date was 
extended to April 1, 2014, in Amendment 6.  Id. at 847, 882.  Amendment 6 also removed the 
requirement that offerors provide FAA Airworthiness Certificates at the time of proposal 
submission.  
 Amendment 6 was spurred by the September 24, 2013 agency protest of Air USA, Inc. 
(“Air USA”).   Id. at 2737, 2759.   In its protest, Air USA argued that requiring offerors to submit 
an FAA Airworthiness Certificate and tail numbers as a prerequisite to award restricted 
competition because only the incumbent would be able to provide this information at the time of 
proposal submission.  Id. at 2744 -45.  Specifically, Air USA contended:  
  
[T]he Agency is not only demanding that the aircraft have FAA Airworthiness 
Certificates and all tail numbers be assigned at least six (6) months before  
6 
 contract award and an additional sixty (60) days before mission readiness, the 
Agency is asking the bidders to make an investment of approximately tens of 
millions of dollars in aircraft to si t on the tarmac and provide all maintenance and 
indirect costs to protect their investment with no return on investment.  In that 
regard and upon information and belief, the incumbent is the only bidder that can 
meet that requirement.  
 
Id. at 2746.   
 
 After Amendment 6 was issued, on October 23, 2013, Air USA filed a supplement to its 
first agency protest.  In this supplement, Air USA argued that an FAA Airworthiness Certificate 
could not be obtained without the aircraft and maintenance records, so changin g the date of 
submission of the FAA Airworthiness Certificates but still requiring airworthiness data at the 
time of proposal submission negated Amendment 6.   Id. at 2761.  Air USA referenced a 
Question and Answer, regarding the timing of submitting airwor thiness data and asked if the 
requirements of Technical Element #2, the airworthiness data, could be submitted at the same 
time as the FAA Airworthiness Certificates.  Id.  The Agency responded no, stating:  
 
Airworthiness Data is a critical component of th e CAS Fighter Jet Source 
Selection. This technical evaluation factor represents fundamental aspects of 
airworthiness and will be used to determine an [offeror’s] airworthiness risk 
assessment while flying under Public Use Status. As a result, this informat ion 
must be received during the evaluation phase of the source selection in order to 
evaluate, assess and make a determination, which is different than receiving the 
FAA certification which only requires validation. Therefore no conflict exists in 
the soli citation and no revision will be made.  
 
Id. at 2762.  On November 5, 2013, the Agency rejected Air USA’s protest, reaffirming that 
airworthiness data was “necessary for proposal evaluation” and “needed at time of proposal 
submission.”  Id. at 2765.   
 
 On November 7, 2013, Air USA filed a Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) 
protest raising the same ground as its agency protest. Id. at 2767. Air USA requested that the 
award date be stayed in its GAO protest.  Id. at 2769.   On February 14, 2014, the GA O denied 
Air USA’s protest, finding that the Agency had “reasonably established a legitimate need for 
airworthiness data documentation at the time of proposal submission,” and that “[g]iven the 
critical need to ensure the safety of government and civilian personnel . . . the agency’s interest 
in evaluating each aircraft’s airworthiness data through a thorough assessment of the 
documentation provided at the time of proposal submission is reasonable to achieve the highest 
level of reliability and effectivenes s.”  Id. at 3243.  
 
Proposal Evaluation Results, Evaluation Notices, and Discussions  
 
 [***]  companies submitted proposals in response to the solicitation – [***] , ATAC, 
Draken, and [***]  -- and were evaluated under the factors of technical, past performance, and 
total evaluated price.  Id. at 3256.  On June 18, 2014, [***]  were given an [***]  rating for the  
7 
 technical factor, with [***]  and [***]  being found a [***]  in this category and Dr aken and 
ATAC being found a [***] .  Id.  In the past performance category, [***]  had a  [***]  rating, both 
ATAC and [***]  were [***]  and Draken was given a [***] rating.  Id.  Draken’s price was the 
[***]  of the [***]  bidders.   Id.  All were found to be [***] with the RFP and all were deemed 
[***]  of receiving the award.  Id.  In determining [***] rating and risk for the technical factor, 
the evaluators noted as one  [***]  that [***]  had not provided any  [***] .  Id. at 3263.  Draken’s 
[***]  included [***].  Id. at 3277. Draken received scores  of [***] [*** ] [***]  [***] .  Id. at 
3280. The April 1, 2014 award date passed without an award being made, and award is now 
anticipated in February 2015.4  The Procuring Contracting Officer testified that the anticipated  
award date has been pushed back several times due to ongoing discussions with the offerors, the 
need for additional time to evaluate proposal revisions, and Draken’s instant bid protests.   
 
 On June 20, 2014, the Agency determined that all offerors were within the competitive 
range and that discussions pursuant to FAR 15.306(d) were necessary due to  [***] . . . .”   Id. at 
3371.  At the beginning of July 2014, NAVAIR sent out 107 evaluation notices (“ENs”) to the 
offerors so that they could provide further information “to assist the Government in its final 
evaluation of the proposals.”  Id. at 3416.5  These ENs addressed various deficiencies in each 
offeror’s proposal.   One EN allowed [***]  to provide the missing airworthiness data required by 
Technical Elem ent # 2, but the record does not indicate whether [***]  provided this data.  Id. at 
3439.  Offerors were originally instructed to respond to the ENs by July 24, 2014, but this date 
was extended to August 4, 2014, at the request of offerors.  Id. at 4467.  
 
 On July 24, 2014, [***]  sent a letter to NAVAIR regarding EN responses, indicating that 
it was redirecting [***] .  Id. at 3801 -02.  The record does not indicate what the Go vernment’s 
response to [***]  letter was.   
 
ATAC Bridge Contract  
 
 While the EN process was ongoing, on July 11, 2014, the Navy issued a Justification and 
Approval For Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (“Justification”) to award ATAC a 
sole-source bridge contract commencing on July 29, 2014, with a three -month b ase period and 
three additional three -month opti on periods, permitting the sole -source contract to last until July 
2015.  Id. at 3373, 3407. The Justification stated that the sole -source contract was necessary to 
prevent a gap in training services between the end of ATAC’s incumbent contract on July 28, 
2014, and the “follow on competitive contract.”   Id. at 3407.  Furthermore, according to the 
                                                           
4  On November 28, 2014, the Government filed a motion to amend th e Administrative 
Record to add a November 26, 2014 Declaration of Phillip Smith, the Procuring Contracting 
Officer.  Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. As this testimony directly relates to the alleged 
excessive timeframe of the procurement  at issue , this motion is granted . See Axiom Res. Mgmt. 
v. United States , 564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   
 
5  Although the AR only contains ENs sent to [***] and [***], and the proposals of these 
two companies in response to the ENs, the record reflects that [***]  offerors received ENs and 
were given an opportunity to respond.  The Agency created a “CAS Fighter Jets EN Matrix” that 
catalogues each EN, each offeror’s res ponse, and the status of resolution.  Id. at 3410. Draken’s 
EN responses are also referenced in the Agency’s denial of its protest.  Id. at 4467.   
8 
 Justification, ATAC had personnel on site and could continue performance and avoid a “gap in 
contractual support” that “would ultimately lead to an unacceptable decrease in mission 
readiness by precluding the pilots and ships the opportunity to train in simulated scenarios.”  Id. 
at 3408.  
 
Draken’s Agency Protest  
 
 On July 24, 2014, Draken filed a protest with NAVAIR  arguing that the short operational 
readiness requirement forced all offerors except the incumbent to possess and maintain aircraft at 
their own expense while the Agency made its selection decision, and the requirement that 
offerors provide both Type III a nd Type IV aircraft “became improperly restrictive when 
combined with the extraordinary procurement delays that the Agency has imposed on this 
process.”  Id. at 4438.  Draken acknowledged that while these requirements “posed some barriers 
to competition” w hen the solicitation was issued, “these limitations arguably were reasonably 
necessary to meet the Agency’s needs and provided the agency a reasonable period of time to 
review offerors’ proposals.”   Id. at 4439.  However, according to Draken, “as the delay s and 
uncertainty in the selection process have mounted, these limitations have made the selection 
process defective and anticompetitive, and have proven to be unnecessary in light of the 
Agency’s needs.”   Id.  In this protest, Draken noted  [***] .  During an August 5, 2014 
teleconference with the Agency regarding its agency protest, Draken confirmed that it would no 
longer be able to meet the Type IV requirement.   Id. at 4467.  
 
 On September 5, 2014, NAVAIR denied Draken’s protest. The Agency found that any  
protest of the inclusion of both Type III and Type IV aircraft was required to be submitted prior 
to the closing date for initial receipt of proposals.   Id. at 4486.  The Agency rejected Draken’s 
argument that the length of the evaluation process could ma ke a requirement that was not 
restrictive at the time of proposal submission unduly restrictive at a later time.    
  
Discussion  
 
Standing  
 
As a preliminary matter, ATAC challenges Draken’s standing.6  Draken “‘bears the 
burden of establishing [the] elements [of standing]’” because it invokes this Court’s jurisdiction.  
Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs. v. United States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002) 
(alterations in original) (quoting Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  To 
have standing in a bid protest, a protestor must be an “interested party.”  Orion Tech., Inc. v. 
United States , 704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , 
448 F.3d 130 5, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  To be an “interested party,” a protestor must show:  (1) 
that it is an “actual or prospective bidder” (2) “whose direct economic interest would be affected 
by the award of the contract.”  Digitalis Educ. Solutions, Inc. v. Unite d States , 664 F.3d 1380, 
1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307).  As the term denotes, an actual bidder is 
one who submitted a bid for the challenged procurement.  Rex, 448 F.3d at 1307.   
                                                           
6  While the Government argues that Draken’s protest of the solicitation terms  is untimely, 
it does not challen ge Draken’s standing to protest.    
9 
  
“Generally, to prove the existence of a direct econo mic interest, a party must show that it 
had a ‘substantial chance’ of winning the contract.”  Orion , 704 F.3d at 1348 (citing Rex, 448 
F.3d at 1308). There is, however, “[a]n exception to that standard [] when a prospective bidder 
challenges the terms of t he solicitation itself, prior to actually submitting a bid.”  Id. (citing 
Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , 575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  In the pre -bid 
context, the protestor can establish a direct economic interest “by demonstrating that it suffered a 
‘non-trivial competitive injury which can be redressed by judicial relief.’” Id. (quoting Weeks 
Marine , 575 F.3d at 1361 -62).   However, where bids have been submitted but an award has not 
been made, the correct test of economic interest is the “substantial chance” test used in the post -
award context, not the “non -trivial competitive injury” test.  Id.  
  
ATAC contends that Draken lacks standing because it has unresolved ENs and can no 
longer meet the Type IV aircraft requirement and thus “curren tly does not have a substantial 
chance of receiving the contract, but for the alleged error.”   Intervenor Mot. for Judgment on the 
AR 20.   To satisfy the substantial chance test, a protester “must demonstrate more than a ‘mere 
possibility that [it] would h ave received the contract but for the [alleged] error [in the 
procurement process].’” CliniComp Int’l v. United States , 117 Fed. Cl. 722, 734 (2014) 
(alternations in original) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Asia Pac. Airlines v. United States , 
68 Fe d. Cl. 8, 18 (2005).  However, “‘a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged 
error, [it] would have been awarded the contract.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Johnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  
 
As ATAC acknowledges, “[t]he question whether a protester ‘ha[s] a substantial chance  
of securing the award,’ turns on whether the protester would have had a substantial chance  if not 
for the alleged errors .”  Comint Sys. Corp. v. United States , 700 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (emphasis added) (quoting Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 275 
F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  The error alleged by Draken in this protest is that the 
Agency’s delay in conducting the proc urement, coupled with its operational readiness 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft, makes the solicitation anti -competitive.  If 
these alleged errors had not occurred, i.e. the Agency had met its original anticipated award date 
and not del ayed the procurement process, Draken could have – as it did – submitted its offer and 
met the solicitation terms, expensive though they were.   Only after the Agency extended the 
anticipated award date by almost a year did the requirements for Type IV aircr aft become 
financially prohibitive.7  As Draken submitted the [***] bid and [***]  ATAC in the technical 
risk category, Draken had a “substantial chance” of being awarded the contract, but for the 
alleged defect in the procurement process – unduly restricti ve solicitation terms and prolonged 
delay.  The fact that Draken has  allegedly  unresolved ENs does not alter this conclusion as the 
EN process has not been concluded.  
                                                           
7  The requirement to supply both Type III and Type IV aircraft became impossible for 
Draken to meet once, after delay, it lost its surprise subcontractor.  Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
23:3-7 (describing how Draken was a ble to originally submit a proposal  due to finding a 
“surprise” subcontractor, who has been “unable to stick with it th roughout these extensive 
delays ”).

Standard of Review for Bid Protests  
 
The Court evaluates bid protests pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard 
of review for an agency action.  Bannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 
2005) (citing Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United State s, 238 F.3d 1324, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  This Court will not disturb an agency’s procurement decision unless the 
Court finds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in 
accordance with law.”   5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2012 ); Adams & Assocs. v. United States , 741 
F.3d 102, 105 -06 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Under Rule  52.1, the parties are limited to the AR , and the 
Court makes findings of fact as if it were conducting a trial on a paper record.  See Bannum , 404 
F.3d at 1356.8  Looki ng to the AR, the Court must determine whether a party has met its burden 
of proof based on the evidence in the record.  Id.    
Plaintiff Failed to Establish that the Agency’s Delay Caused the Solicitation Requirements 
to Become Unduly Restrictive in Viola tion of CICA  
 
 Plaintiff contends that the Agency violated CICA citing “two primary defects” in the 
solicitation -- the combination of Type III and Type IV services and the 60 -day operational 
readiness requirement -- which, “in combination with Agency dela ys, unduly restrict 
competition.”   Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  Draken acknowledges that “[w]hile the 
[s]olicitation requirements initially appeared difficult but reasonable” based on the Agency’s 
“promised” award timeline, “they are no longer reas onable now that the Agency has decided to 
extend the timeframe for making an award by up to five times  its original estimate.”   Id. at 15 
(emphasis in original). Thus , in Plaintiff’s view, while the solicitation did not contain anti -
competitive terms at th e time of proposal submission, the subsequent delay in the procurement 
process rendered these terms anti -competitive.   
 
Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Solicitation Terms is Untimely  
 
 To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the solicitation’s requirements for operational 
readiness and both Type III and Type IV aircraft unduly restrict competition, such an argument is 
untimely.  As the Federal Circuit held in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , “a party who 
has the opportunity to object to the terms of  a government solicitation containing a patent error 
and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same 
objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  492 F.3d 1308, 
1313 (Fed . Cir. 2007).  “[W]here there is a ‘deficiency or problem in a solicitation . . . the proper 
procedure for the offeror to follow is not to wait to see if it is the successful offeror before 
deciding whether to challenge the procurement, but rather to raise  the objection in a timely 
fashion.’”  Id. at 1314 (alteration in original) (citing N.C. Div. of Servs. for the Blind v. United 
States , 53 Fed. Cl. 147, 165 (2002); see also  Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States , 
68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005); MVM, Inc. v. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 126, 130 (2000); 
                                                           
8  ATAC relies upon documents that are not part of the AR. Pursuant to Rule 52.1, the 
Court has not considered these documents.  See Intervenor Br. 6 n. 1 -2, 7 n. 3, 8 n. 4 -5, 9 n. 6 -8, 
10 n. 9, 31 n. 18 -19.  
11 
 Allied Tech. Group, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 146 (1997); Aerolease Long Beach v. 
United States , 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 358 (1994)).  
 
Plaintiff’s Claim of  Undue Procurement Delay is Timely and Reviewable   
 
While Blue & Gold  prevents Plaintiff from challenging solicitation terms, it does not 
prevent Draken from protesting alleged pre -award deficiencies in the procurement process. The 
delay that Draken argues  has made the procurement process anti -competitive was not a term of 
the solicitation.  There was no basis on the face of the solicitation for Plaintiff to challenge what 
later became, in its view, an unduly lengthy procurement process. The solicitation st ated that the 
“anticipated” award date was March 1, 2014, information that was to be used by bidders as “a 
basis for schedules and burden (labor, overheads, G&A, etc.) mid -point calculations.”  AR 586.  
Plaintiff does not contend that this solicitation ter m was defective, only that the Agency’s 
subsequent departure from that anticipated date rendered the procurement anti -competitive.  As 
Draken is not challenging a solicitation term, but instead the combination of delay in the 
procurement process with requi rements that allegedly became unduly restrictive due to this 
delay, Draken’s protest is timely under Blue & Gold .   
 
Plaintiff Has Not Established a Violation of CICA  
 
The plaintiff in a bid protest bears the burden of proving that a “clear and prejudicial ” 
error marred the procurement in question.  CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States , 854 F.2d 
464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Kinetic Structures Corp. v. United States , 6 Cl.Ct. 387, 394 
(1984); DeMat Air, Inc. v. United States , 2 Cl.Ct. 197, 202 (198 3)).  Plaintiff contends that the 
Agency’s delay in the procurement process coupled with the solicitation requirements for Type 
III and Type IV aircraft and operational readiness caused offerors “to bear expenses five times 
longer than forecast” and violat ed CICA.  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 25.  
  
Plaintiff presents no authority to support the proposition that it is a violation of CICA for 
an agency to delay an award, causing “difficult but reasonable” solicitation requirements to 
become unduly restri ctive of competition due to the passage of time.  CICA requires procuring 
agencies to “obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in 
accordance with the requirements of this division [41 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq.] and the Feder al 
Acquisition Regulation” and to “use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive 
procedures,” such as sealed bids “that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.”  
41 U.S.C. § 3301 (2012).   
 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated th at the procedures NAVAIR used in the instant negotiated 
procurement – which still has [***]  offerors – were anti -competitive or violated any statutory or 
FAR provision.  Plaintiff does not allege a failure of the Agency to use an identified competitive 
procedure required by CICA and the FAR.  Rather, Plaintiff persists in attempting to raise an 
untimely challenge to the facial terms of the solicitation, by protesting the delay in the 
procurement process.  While CICA sets forth procedures for the Government to sustain a policy 
of full and open competition, the statute does not mandate that a procurement take place in a 
certain amount of time or expressly provide that any delay, let alone reasonable, justified delay , 
is prohibited.   While Plaintiff suggests that it may have to drop out of the competition because it  
12 
 can no longer provide Type IV aircraft, it has not yet withdrawn and there is no evidence that the 
other [***]  offerors cannot meet the Type IV requirement or are planning  to withdraw.  Indeed, 
Plaintiff requests alternative relief that suggests that it could remain in the competition -- that the 
Agency “allow all offerors, including Draken, a reasonable opportunity to offer new aircraft in 
the even t that aircraft that were  originally proposed are no longer available due to the delays in 
the procurement process.”  Am. Compl. at 26.   Plaintiff has not established that the restrictive 
solicitation terms and delay caused a reduction in competition that rises to the level of a v iolation 
of CICA.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that the Agency violated § 3306(a)(2)(B) of CICA which provides 
that agencies may “include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.”  41 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)(B) 
(2012).  Plaintiff identifies the Agency’s “restri ctive provision” here as the solicitation’s 
requirements for both Type III and Type IV aircraft and for operational readiness coupled with 
the delay in conduct of the procurement.  However, Plaintiff cannot establish restrictive 
solicitation provisions her e because its challenge to these solicitation terms is untimely.  Plaintiff 
admits that these solicitation provisions were not restrictive  at the time it submitted its offer.  In 
plaintiff’s view, what made the provisions  restrictive  under CICA was the len gth of time the 
procurement took.  But, as Plaintiff admits, this delay did not result from any fault of the Agency 
-- either arbitrary and capricious conduct or a separate statutory or regulatory violation. The 
original solicitation had an anticipated awa rd date of March 1, 2014.  AR at 586.   In Amendment 
6, due to the Air USA protest and the change in the proposal submission date, the Agency moved 
the anticipated award date to April 1, 2014.  The Agency did not make an award on April 1, 
2014, but continue s to engage in discussions with offerors and now anticipates awarding the 
contract in February 2015. Decl. of Phillip Smith ¶ 9.  These delays have been caused by 
legitimate, unremarkable procurement occurrences -- pre-award agency -level and GAO protests 
by Air USA and Draken, and the Agency’s need to evaluate offerors’ responses to 107 ENs and  
conduct discussions.  See id. at ¶¶ 7 -9. 
 
Plaintiff purports to combine two agency actions, neither of which was independently 
illegal, to construct a violation of procurement law. But Plaintiff’s invocation of procurement 
delay does not either convert what were legal solicitation terms into illegal terms, or grant 
Plaintiff a reprieve for its untimely challenge to solicitation terms. If this Court permitted 
Plaintif f to pursue an untimely challenge to solicitation terms and ordered the Agency to revise 
the belatedly challenged solicitation terms merely because there was subsequent legitimate 
procurement delay, the Court would do violence to Blue & Gold.  
 
In addition to failing to demonstrate that this procurement delay created the type of 
“restrictive solicitation provisions” prohibited by CICA, Plaintiff has failed to appreciate that the 
Agency amply justified these challenged solicitation terms. The no -fault delay t hat ensued did 
not vitiate that Justification. The Assistant Secretary’s Determination and Findings articulated 
rational reasons for including the Type IV supersonic aircraft along with the Type III subsonic 
aircraft in this procurement:  
  
13 
  The efficiencies gained by having a single provider provide all resources at all 
sites as compared to having two contractors at each location using additional 
space, tooling, and personnel.  
 
 The ability to fulfill Type III missions with Type IV aircraft billed at the lowe r 
Type III rate, which allowed the Government “to minimize the required quantity 
of high subsonic aircraft without compromising the ability to cover surge 
requirements.”   
 
 The avoidance of  a scenario where two contractors would use overlapping 
resources, which would cause logistical difficulties, reduce the funds available for 
training and decrease the quality of training provided.  
 
 The recognition that t he task orders under the contract are so integrally related 
that only a single source could reasonably  perform the effort.  
 
 The avoidance of duplication of costs to provide and maintain multiple fleets of 
aircraft.  
 
AR 4470 -71.   
 
It is well settled that an agency has discretion in defining its needs. See Che Consulting, 
Inc. v. United States , 74 Fed. Cl. 742, 747 (2006) (“ An agency’s determination of the ‘best 
method of accommodating’  its needs . . . falls within the agency's discretion.”  (quoting United 
Enter. & Assocs. v. United States , 70 Fed. Cl. 1, 26 (2006)).  This Court would be hard pressed 
to forc e the Agency to redefine its needs here because such needs have allegedly become 
unjustified due to delay that did not result from any procurement error or irrational agency 
decision.   
 
This is not to say that an agency’s procurement delay is either a mat ter of unfettered 
agency discretion or immune from judicial review.  The Government submits that procurement 
delay is purely a matter of procedure that has no effect on the validity of the procurement and 
does not alone provide a basis to protest.  Def. Cr oss-Mot. for Judgment on the AR 18 (citing 
Am. Fuel Cell and Coated Fabrics Co. , B-234395, Feb. 21, 1989, 89 -1 CPD ¶ 183 (holding that a 
contractor’s protest of an agency’s delay in making an award had no merit because “a delay in 
meeting procurement miles tones is a procedural deficiency which does not alone provide a basis 
of protest, because it has no effect on the validity of the procurement ”).  This Court does not 
agree.  Rather, an agency’s illegal, irrational, or arbitrary delay could provide both a b asis for 
protest and relief.  An agency has an obligation of good faith and fair dealing to bidders 
participating in Federal procurements, and that duty would prohibit an agency from arbitrarily  
unduly delaying a procurement by stringing offerors along, re quiring them to be at the ready at 
substantial expense for an unnecessarily extended period. See generally  Heyer Prod. Co. v. 
United States , 135 Ct. Cl. 63, 71 (1956). However, this is not the argument Plaintiff is pressing 
in this case.  Plaintiff emphasi zes that it is not claiming that the procurement delay here resulted 
from any arbitrary, capricious, or irrational conduct by the Agency. Dec. 8, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr.  
14 
 13:13 -21. (“[W]e are not ascribing fault to the agency for the delays. [. . .] And it's not  necessary, 
in our view, to say that the delays were the ag ency’ s fault.”).   
 
Draken’s Contention That It Was Treated Differently Than Other Offerors is Unripe  
 
 Draken argues that the Agency treated it unfairly because the Agency repeatedly stressed 
the importance of providing airworthiness data with the initial proposals, yet “appears to have 
waived the requirement eight months  after offerors were required to com ply” for [***]  and 
[***] .  Pl. Mot. for Judgment on the AR 32 -35 (emphasis in original).  Plaintiff speculates that 
the Agency may accept this data from other offerors, will rely on this data, and will not afford 
Draken a similar opportunity to provide suc h data.  Id. at 34 -35.   
 
ATAC submits  that Draken’s arguments that it was treated unfairly and prejudicially are 
not ripe because the award has not yet been made.  Intervenor’s Mot. for Judgment on the AR at 
34-35.  The Court agrees with ATAC.  This procu rement is still ongoing, and the current state of 
evaluations and discussions is unknown.  Ripeness is a doctrine of justiciability that prevents the 
courts, “through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements  over administrative policies . . . .” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 
(1967).   A claim is not ripe for judicial review when it is contingent upon future events that may 
or may not occur.   Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co. , 473 U.S. 568,  580-81 (1985).  In 
assessing ripeness, there are two basic factors: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial 
decision[;] and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Sys. 
Application & Techs. v. United States , 691 F.3d 13 74, 1383 -1384 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Abbott Labs. , 387 U.S. at 149); Tex. Bio - & Agro -Def. Consortium v. United States , 87 Fed. Cl. 
798, 804 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  In order to be a final decision, and therefore ripe for judicial review, 
(1) there must be an agency action that marks “‘the consummation of the agency's 
decisionmaking process,’ i.e., it must not be merely tenta tive or interlocutory, and (2) ‘the action 
must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal 
consequenc es will flow.’”   NSK, Ltd. v. United States , 510 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) 
(quoting Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).  
 
 Here, whether Draken will be treated unfairly and prejudicially compared to [***]  and 
[***]  is not yet known and canno t be ascertained until the Agency selects an awardee.  In Texas 
Bio- & Agro -Defense Consortium , this Court recognized that a proposed site selection was not 
ripe for judicial review because negotiations over the transfer of the property to the agency had 
not been concluded and because any transfer of the property was contingent upon Congressional 
funding. 87 Fed. Cl. at 804 -06. This Court reasoned that given the uncertainty over what form 
the potential transfer of land and in -kind contributions from the Int ervenor to the agency might 
take and the multiple potential contingencies, the site selection was not fit for judicial review.  
Id. at 806.  Similarly, in the instant case, the outcome of what Draken claims is an unfair 
evaluation process has not yet occurred, as the Agency is still in the pre -award evaluation stage 
of this procurement.  Decl. of Philip Smith ¶¶ 4 -5.  The “consummatio n of the agency’s 
decisionmaking process” will not occur until award.   See NSK, Ltd. , 510 F.3d at 1385.  
  
 Deciding not to review this alleged unequal treatment does not impose any hardship on 
Draken. “[W]ithholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where  
15 
 the complained -of conduct has an ‘immediate and substantial impact’ on the plaintiff.”   Caraco 
Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc. , 527 F.3d 1278, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Gardner 
v. Toilet Goods Ass’ n, 387 U.S. 1 67,171 (1967)); Texas Bio - & Agro -Defense Consortium , 87 
Fed. Cl. at 806.  Withholding consideration of this issue will not harm Draken, as the conduct 
that it complains of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.  
   
This Court Will Not Review the Agency’s Denial of Draken’s Agency -Level Protest  
Draken argues the Agency’s protest decision was irrational and that the Agency “failed to 
provide a coherent and reasonable explanation that justified its decision to deny Draken’s 
protest.”  Pl. Mot. for Ju dgment on the AR 30 -33.  In the bid protest realm, the Court of Federal 
Claims is not an appellate tribunal empowered to directly review protest decisions of the agency 
or the GAO.  Cf. Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989); MG 
Altus Apache Co. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 425, 443 (Fed. Cl. 2013) (“While this Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review a GAO decision outright, it may assess whether the GAO decision 
was rational in order to determine whether the procurement actio n be ing challenged — the 
agency’ s corrective action predicated on that GAO decision — was reasonable.”) (citing 
Honeywell, Inc. , 870 F.2d at 647 -648).   
 
Under § 1491(b)(1), the Court has jurisdiction in bid protest cases “to render judgment on 
an action by an  interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or 
proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any 
alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a propos ed 
procurement.”   28 U.S.C. 1491(b)(1) (2012).  An agency protest is not a procurement.  Thus, 
while Draken may disagree with the agency’s denial of its protest, the Court does n ot have 
jurisdiction to review or remand the agency’s protest decision, but in stead reviews the agency’s 
underlying procurement decision or procurement -related actions.  In any event, Plaintiff’s 
challenge to the Agency’s protest decision here simply rehashes the grounds of protest it pursued 
in this forum -- which this Court reject ed without evaluating the agency protest decision.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and  
Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief.  
 
The Court  GRANTS  Defendant’s  motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and 
Intervenor’s motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.  The Court directs the Clerk to 
enter judgment accordingly.

**Cleaned Web Content:**
The main article discusses Draken International, a private company that operates the world's largest private air force. Founded in 2011, the company has grown rapidly and currently undertakes training activities for the US military. Draken International operates a fleet of aircraft, including A-4s, MiG-21s, and MB-339s, which are flown by ex-military pilots.

The company's business model is based on providing cost-effective training solutions to the military, with hourly operating costs significantly lower than those of front-line fighter jets. Draken International also argues that its services can help extend the life expectancy of military aircraft, as well as reduce the risk of "negative training" where pilots are forced to fly missions that are not relevant to real-world scenarios.

The company is currently looking to expand its operations to Europe, where it sees growing demand for its services. Draken International does not handle high-end missions undertaken by US Aggressor units, but instead focuses on simulating third-generation and early fourth-generation threats.

The article also mentions that the company's pilots are drawn from ex-military ranks, with many having previously flown A-4s and F-16s. The MiG-21s, however, required specialized training, which was provided by Aerostar in Romania.

The remaining articles appear to be unrelated news briefs from the aviation industry:

* Airbus Defence & Space has delivered its eighth A330-200-based multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) to a multinational unit based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands.
* Bell has performed the first flight of a CH-146 Griffon utility helicopter upgraded under a modernisation programme for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
* Mesa Air Group has posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in almost three years as it continues to regain its financial footing.
The article discusses the increasing cost of using front-line aircraft for operational training and the rise of commercial air support contracts. Companies such as Draken International, Top Aces, Tactical Air Support, and ATAC are competing for lucrative contracts like the US Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF) Adversary Air (ADAIR) and UK Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) contracts.

These companies provide various services including adversary air, Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) training, Electronic Warfare (EW) training, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and test chase, and air traffic and fighter controller training. They have fleets of aircraft such as F-16s, Alphajets, McDonnell Douglas A-4N Skyhawks, IAI Westwind 1124 bizjets, and others.

The contracts are expected to be worth billions of dollars over several years, with the CAF ADAIR contract estimated to be around $6 billion over 10 years. The companies will need to provide a high number of flying hours, around 37,000 per year, which will require a significant fleet of aircraft and personnel.

The article suggests that affordability will be a key issue in the bidding process, but also notes that there will be a demand for more sophisticated aircraft across different capability categories. This could lead to partnerships between companies and opportunities for new entrants into the market.
The article discusses Draken International, a company that provides commercial air services (CAS) to the US government. The company owns over 50 tactical fighter jets, including Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, MiG-21s, and Aermacchi MB-339s, making it the largest privately-owned fleet in the world.

Draken International differentiates itself from other firms in this space through its organizational infrastructure, financial resources, maintenance practices, and aircraft capabilities. The company's A-4K Skyhawks have undergone a several hundred million-dollar upgrade program, giving them generation-four capabilities that are unmatched in the industry.

The company provides a range of services, including "Red Air" adversary support, research and development, joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) training, and more. Draken International's pilots are full-time employees trained on one airframe, ensuring safety, professionalism, and high-quality service.

The company is headquartered in Lakeland, Florida, but also operates from facilities at BAE System's Mojave Air and Spaceport in California. Draken International's leadership team has considerable tactical aviation experience, and its CEO, Jared Isaacman, brings business savvy and a passion for aviation to the company.

Draken International plans to sustain itself through its commitment to purchasing and maintaining high-quality aircraft, as well as building an indigenous supply line that ensures maximum sortie rates. The company also sees potential in providing its services outside of the continental United States (CONUS) to foreign air forces, particularly across NATO nations.
The document appears to be a court ruling in a bid protest case. Here's a summary of the content:

* The plaintiff, Draken, is challenging an evaluation process conducted by the Agency, claiming it was unfair and prejudicial.
* The court rules that the issue is not yet ripe for judicial review because the Agency has not yet selected an awardee, and the outcome of the evaluation process is still uncertain.
* The court cites previous cases (NSK, Ltd. v. United States and Texas Bio- & Agro-Defense Consortium) to support its decision that the site selection is not fit for judicial review until the Agency's decision-making process is complete.
* The court also finds that withholding consideration of Draken's claim does not impose any hardship on Draken, as the conduct complained of may not ultimately persist or prejudice Draken.
* Additionally, the court rules that it lacks jurisdiction to directly review the Agency's protest decision and can only assess whether the procurement action being challenged was reasonable.
* The court denies Draken's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record and motion for injunctive relief, and grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the Administrative Record.

In summary, the court is dismissing Draken's claims, citing that the issue is not yet ripe for review, and that it lacks jurisdiction to review the Agency's protest decision.
